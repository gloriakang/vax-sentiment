## Centrality

#### Degree centrality

#### Closeness centrality

#### Betweenness centrality
Betweenness centrality measure for each node shows how often it appears on the shortest path between any two random nodes in the network. It indicates the importance of a node to the overall connectivity of the network; nodes that connect distinct separated communities together will have a higher measure of betweenness centrality.

#### Modularity
Modularity algorithm scans through all the relations between the nodes, grouping them into communities on the basis of how densely they are connected together. If nodes are more tightly-knit together than to the rest of the network, they are considered to be part of a distinct community.
