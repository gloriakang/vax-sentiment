370,triple hit,includes,environmental trigger,
371,environmental trigger,strikes during particular window in,brain development,
372,MMR vaccine,is not that,environmental trigger,say health experts
373,MMR vaccine,no evidence that it raised,autism risk,in either group of children
374,children with affected older sibling,no evidence that MMR vaccine raised,autism risk,
375,children without affected older sibling,no evidence that MMR vaccine raised,autism risk,
376,children with affected older sibling and who had received MMR vaccine,were actually one-quarter less likely to be diagnosed with,ASD,one dose by age 2
377,MMR vaccine,is probably not protective against,autism,said Dr. Bryan King
378,vaccination,was not associated with an increased risk in children with or without an affected,sibling,
