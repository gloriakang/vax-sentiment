    "# Centrality\n",
    "Gives a rough indication of the social power of a node based on how well they \"connect\" the network. \"Betweenness\", \"Closeness\", and \"Degree\" are all measures of centrality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Degree centrality\n",
    "Degree centrality refers to the number of connections (edges) that a node has; often interpreted in terms of immediate risk of that node catching whatever is spreading through the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- in-degree: number of (incoming) edges directed to a node\n",
    "- out-degree: number of (outgoing) edges the node directs to others\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Betweenness centrality\n",
    "Betweenness centrality measure for each node shows how often it appears on the shortest path between any two random nodes in the network. This measure takes into account the connectivity of the node's neighbors, giving a higher value for nodes which bridge clusters. The measure reflects the number of people who a person is connecting indirectly through their direct links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes that occur on many shortest paths between other nodes have higher betweenness than those that do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "It indicates the importance of a node to the overall connectivity of the network; nodes that connect distinct separated communities together will have a higher measure of betweenness centrality. Additionally, nodes with the highest betweenness centrality represent polysingularity, as they appear more often bridging separate communities together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Closeness centrality\n",
    "Closeness is preferred in network analysis to mean shortest-path length, as it gives higher values to more central vertices, and so is usually positively associated with other measures such as degree.\n",
    "In network theory, defined as the mean geodesic distance (i.e., the shortest path) between a vertex v and all other vertices reachable from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closeness: The degree an individual is near all other individuals in a network (directly or indirectly). It reflects the ability to access information through the \"grapevine\" of network members. Thus, closeness is the inverse of the sum of the shortest distances between each individual and every other person in the network. (See also: Proxemics) The shortest path may also be known as the \"geodesic distance\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- `nx: if the graph is not completely connected, this algorithm computes the closeness centrality for each connected part separately.`\n",
    "- `nx: if the ‘distance’ keyword is set to an edge attribute key then the shortest-path length will be computed using Dijkstra’s algorithm with that edge attribute as the edge weight.`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current flow closeness**: Current-flow closeness centrality is variant of closeness centrality based on effective resistance between nodes in a network. This metric is also known as information centrality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current-flow betweenness**: Current-flow betweenness centrality uses an electrical current model for information spreading in contrast to betweenness centrality which uses shortest paths. Current-flow betweenness centrality is also known as random-walk betweenness centrality\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Eigenvector centrality\n",
    "Eigenvector centrality computes the centrality for a node based on the centrality of its neighbors; a measure of importance of a node in a network. It assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the principle that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question than equal connections to low-scoring nodes. Google's PageRank is a variant of the Eigenvector centrality measure."
