<p><em>Note from VaxTruth: &nbsp;We have received many comments about this article. The author has submitted an update (2/3/15) in response to some of the questions that have been raised. Please see the EDIT at the end of this post.</em></p>
<p>Before the MMR vaccine, measles was at epidemic proportions. Before the vaccine, the US had 3-4 million cases of measles! That’s insane! Thank goodness for vaccines.</p>
<p>The end.</p>
<p>Aw, now you didn’t think I’d let vaccines get off &nbsp;THAT easy did you?</p>
<p>Prior to the vaccine, 3-4 million cases of measles occured in the United States each year. &lt;—True.</p>
<p>Also true, however, is that of those 3-4 million cases, only about 450 people died each year from it in the years before the vaccine.</p>
<p>That still seems like a lot? Instead of running out to make sure your vaccinations are up to date, how about a shot of perspective instead?</p>
<p>In the screen shot below, I have figured out the percentage of people who died from measles of all of the&nbsp;measles cases back then. &nbsp;<strong>0.015%</strong>. &nbsp;Suddenly, measles seems a little less scary doesn’t it? The CDC claims that around 1 or 2 out of a thousand people who get measles will die from measles. Their math doesn’t add up though. I guess they use the term “about” lightly.</p>
<p><a href="./Putting Measles Into Perspective _ VaxTruth.org_files/MMR-deaths-vaccine.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="MMR deaths vaccine" src="./Putting Measles Into Perspective _ VaxTruth.org_files/MMR-deaths-vaccine.jpg" alt="measles vaccination statistics" width="700" height="550"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*CLICK TO ENLARGE*</p>
<p>Also, consider that in 1963, the population was&nbsp;189,241,798. That means that&nbsp;<strong>prior to the vaccine, the percentage of the entire US population that died from measles was .000237%.&nbsp;</strong>(Remember this figure, because it will be important in about two paragraphs.)</p>
<p>Now, if you read the little excerpt above, you might be scared, because even with vaccines, the global death count for children from measles is 197,000 in the stats above! &nbsp;That’s a scare tactic and it makes me mad. First of all, it wasn’t 197,000 children. It was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=29188&Cr=world+health+organization&Cr1=disease" target="_blank">197,000 people and some of them were children</a>.</p>
<p>Then the excerpt above goes on to talk about present day figures. There are over 6 billion people on the planet. That’s shown as &nbsp;6,000,000,000 numerically. Correct me if you disagree, but when over<strong> 150,000 people die each day total,&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;is 540 people dying of measles each day really that outrageous? &nbsp;They’re counting on us not comprehending the vast population of our global society. 240,000 children in low income countries alone die each year of neonatal infection.&nbsp;1.26<em><strong>&nbsp;million</strong></em>&nbsp;people die each year from diabetes and yet they’re still pushing the high fructose corn syrup in school lunches.</p>
<p>With vaccines, the US went from a .000237 PERCENT death rate &nbsp;among the general population from measles in 1963 to a 0.000000% measles death rate. It’s a different story around the world though (as the WHO points out to scare the crap out of you.) Currently, around 197,000 people die each year from measles… out of 6 billion. Want to know percent that equals? The calculator showed: 3.28e-5.</p>
<p>***pencil scratches on paper, moving the decimal point to the left five places because of the -e***</p>
<p><em>0.0000328.</em></p>
<p>***calculator clicking***</p>
<p>Which brings the percentage of people who die globally from measles today to:</p>
<p><strong>0.00328%.</strong>&nbsp;(Remember when I told you to remember that figure above?)</p>
<h2><em><strong>0.000237%&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<strong>0.00328%</strong></strong></em></h2>
<p>So, comparing the two figures, as a country, we Americans did better in 1963 at not dying from measles than the general population of the world is doing RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p>But in fairness to vaccines, when compared to our own progress as a country, we no longer have that&nbsp;<strong>.0002%&nbsp;</strong>of our population dying of measles. Right?</p>
<p>But I digress, let’s compare measles death rates in 1963 to other death rates in 1963.</p>
<p><strong>In 1963, there were about 450 deaths from measles.</strong>&nbsp;<em>Meanwhile,</em>&nbsp;about 12,000 people died from stomach ulcers and the likes. &nbsp;Just over 43,000 people died from car accidents in 1963. Over 700,000 people died from heart disease.</p>
<p>In 1963, you were more likely to be one of the 9200 people murdered that year than to die of measles. If you were born in 1963, you were more likely to die from a congenital disease than from measles. In 1963, it was about 46 times more likely for a child to die from a congenital malformation than for someone to die from the measles.</p>
<p><strong>Frankly, in 1963, you were about 46 times more likely to kill yourself than you were to die from measles.</strong></p>

<h2><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>“MEASLES WAS GOING AWAY ANYWAY.”</strong></span></h2>
<p>And at any rate, and I just know this makes pro-vax people upset to hear, measles was already declining prior to the vaccination. The US graphs you can find indicate a huge visual decline, but the way the numbers are set up in the vertical axis is misleading. &nbsp;Check out how the axis representing the difference between 0 and 1 is represented by the same space as the difference between 2 and 20? I highlighted it in yellow for you. &nbsp;Another vaccine awareness group added the dotted red line, but I think that the vertical axis manipulation is even more crucial. So, visually, it looks like a huge decline after the vaccine was introduced:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, finding the specific numbers per year has proved challenging for me, but thankfully, I found a similar graph (similar numbers, but unofficial source) that has not included an exponentially growing vertical axis so that you can see the trend in declining measles rates prior to and including after the vaccine introduction more accurately:</p>

<p><strong>See that tiny blip right around 1967? That’s when vaccines “drastically” reduced measles deaths.</strong></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>SO, WHAT IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO VACCINATE AND YOUR CHILD GETS MEASLES?</strong></span></h2>
<p>Well,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2521770/pdf/brmedj07409-0012.pdf" target="_blank">as early as 1932, doctors</a>&nbsp;began using cod-liver oil (high in vitamin A) to treat measles and ended up lowering the mortality rate significantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990, the&nbsp;<em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>&nbsp;confirmed that vitamin A supplements significantly reduce measles complications and death rates. &nbsp;It would be interesting to know what kind of impact essential oils such as oil of oregano with antiviral qualities or better yet,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/measles-000105.htm" target="_blank">homeopathy</a>, would have had on measles as well. At the very least though, you don’t have to stress as much,&nbsp;<strong>0.015%</strong>mortality rate among measles infected people is just not very scary.</p>
<p>Not nearly as scary as the monster under the bed.</p>

<p>February 3, 2015: &nbsp;EDIT: The following was submitted by the author as an addendum to answer some of the questions raised in the comments to this article.</p>
<div>********</div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">The above article was written only to convey a more accurate picture of the death toll of measles prior to the vaccine. It was not an attempt to change anyone’s decision to vaccinate or not vaccinate. It was to shed light on the actual statistics. See.&nbsp;</span>I wrote it at a time when parents were being told how deadly measles is by using articles that cited worldwide measles death rates as though those represented the likelihood of death rates in the United States.</div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">Measles infections were going away, but I was not clear in my explanation, because it was not the focus of the article. Death rates were. Plus, I believed it was glaringly obvious since I was specifically discussing population growth when examining deaths from measles. I’d like to address my claim now that it is apparent that people are also interested in how I could state that measles infections were on their way out.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">The CDC uses the<b> number of cases</b>, as opposed to the <b>rate of cases </b>of measles infections, making no attempt to adjust for the drastic population growth in the decade just before the first vaccine was licensed: The Baby Boom. In addition, they do not address the historic 2-3 year cycle of measles.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DRASTIC POPULATION INCREASE, PLATEAUED CASES</span></span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">Our population rose from 139.9M in 1945 to 189.5M in 1963: &nbsp;That’s almost FIFTY MILLION new Americans. Greater than an additional 1/3 of the population was added to the U.S., but it is not even considered when presenting measles data.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">In 1958, we saw a large spike in the actual &nbsp;number measles cases (nearly 800K), that is true. &nbsp;This would be expected, given that the Baby Boomers were highly susceptible because they were children, previously unexposed and almost exclusively fed formula (and did not get measles antibodies during infancy from their mothers’ milk.) &nbsp;After that spike, we would expect to see another spike in two to three years, because that is the historic cycle. But that never happened. The number of cases held at around the 400K level, despite the population continuing to increase.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">Though the first measles vaccines (which was deemed a failure in ability to create antibodies) was not licensed until the later part of the measles season on the sixth year of the cycle, there was still no major spike. The next measles vaccine was licensed near the end of that measles season that same year. Meanwhile, in the five year span between the 1958 spike and the first vaccines, the population grew by 14.6 million.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OTHER FACTORS</span></span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">In 1957, the AAP’s new committee on nutrition released the new guidelines that doctors would use. In 1958 and 59, when almost every single baby was drinking formula instead of breastmilk, commercial infant formulas were finally fortified with iron. &nbsp;In 1960, Miles Laboratory developed Chocks, the first chewable multivitamin aimed at children. Flinstones followed shortly thereafter. In January of 1961 Kennedy’s first executive order mandated that the USDA donations to the poor include a variety of fresh foods rather than whatever was at a surplus that year. Later, that same year, the USDA was required to donate foods to schools for children who could not afford food. Kennedy continued to support initiatives that helped the poor and minorities until his death in November 1963. The work he began continued after his death. In 1964, President Johnson launched the “War on Poverty.” 1964 brought on the “Food Stamp Act.” Medicare and Medicaid were offered to Americans in 1965. Additionally, by 1965 the proportion of people living in poverty decreased by about 1/3 when compared to the numbers in 1950.</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING DATA</span></span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ac193d;">Another great way to show that measles cases had been declining is to look at military records. They used actual rates, kept great records and focused in one one specific age range. In the Civil War, &nbsp;which was in the 1860, the cases reported were 32.2 per 1000 person years. &nbsp;The rate drops to 26.1 in the Spanish American War. During World War I, it was 23.8. &nbsp;And in the second world war, it was down to 4.7 per 1000 man years. It was the same rate decline in the Royal Navy records as well, which recorded a little differently, but still showed a decline. &nbsp;In WWI, the rate of measles was 16.0 per patients admitted for the entire duration. In WWII, the case rate was 2.9 per patients admitted.</span></div>

Developing world conditions in fact.</p>
<p>I think the declining rate of measles in your chart is inaccurate. What you are showing is that reported cases of measles were declining. However, the serological evidence seems to show that 95% or more of the population who were children before the measles vaccine came into use ended up immune to measles. This makes sense, of course, if a child has a mild case of measles, it isn’t likely to be reported. It is even possible that some children developed immunity without showing clear symptoms, so they weren’t even diagnosed, much less reported.</p>
<p>Good article!</p>

This really puts it in perspective quite well.  not to mention that by people obtaining natural immunity to the disease and creating a natural herd immunity may have led to the decline as well, definately NOT the vaccines.

Anyway, what are your thoughts on SSPE?<br>
Also its not only death whcih concerns me as I know that risk is low, its the much higher risk of blindness, deafness, brain damage, meningitis etc??? those rates are much higher are they no?<br>

If you are, please let us know your full name and where you practice. Anyone can comment and claim to be anything. We will need proof before just accepting what you claim. If you are a pediatrician, I realize this concept may be foreign to you. Get over it. This is my space. I’m not in your office.<br>
Second, if you are a pediatrician, I would like to see your personal vaccination record. Have you received all of the vaccines you are mandating for the infants and children in your care? If not, don’t you present a threat to them when you examine them, breathe in their faces, and touch their bodies?<br>
Third, you want to “hold parents responsible for the uneducated decisions they make financially?” Finances is what you are concerned about? I made uneducated decisions for my daughter when I followed blindly the advice (and bowed to coercive tactics) of her pediatricians and didn’t research the vaccines she was injected with. As a result, my daughter was seriously harmed to the point where I had to leave the Ph.D. program I was enrolled in, and now am faced with paying many thousands of dollars in student loan debt I can’t afford because I’ve been unable to work consistently because my daughter’s vaccine-injuries have required that I stay at home with her. It is quite telling that you are only concerned about finances. And for the record, my daughter has now been diagnosed with a “primary” immune deficiency syndrome. Would she have had it if she wasn’t fully vaccinated with vaccines containing immune-toxic ingredients? I don’t know. I wish I could have found out. She is no longer able to receive any vaccines and is one of those people you seem to care about. I love her dearly, but there is NO WAY I would EVER ask another parent to put his or her child through what my family has been through in order to protect my daughter. She is my responsibility and I will care for her the best I can. Each parent has that right.<br>
Fourth, if you really are a pediatrician and you are “glad to see patients being asked to leave pediatric practices across the country” and you “do the same thing” then we really do need to know your full name and where you practice, because you are violating the American Academy of Pediatrics own policy on this matter. You are clearly an egomaniacal control-freak who doesn’t deserve ANY parent’s trust.<br>
Please provide your full name and the details on where you practice.</p>

My child had an adverse reaction to the MMR. Sadly I found out to late the the adverse reactions were known to be possible and the pediatrician never told me, yet made sure I signed on the parent line to be the one held legally responsible for the decision. People kill me when they find out I do not vaccinate my child on the suggested time table. I wasn’t vaccinated on that time table, I was born in 1974, I never even saw the end of a Hep B needle until I went to study abroad at age 19. I is amazing how many people place their blind faith in the pharmaceutical company. It is amazing how school insist on vaccines despite the fact that all states have exemption allowances for religion. It is always amusing to me when people say that kids like mine are a danger to theirs. Okay, well you have no idea how many children on the playground at any give day are vaccinated anyway, and furthermore, my kid had an adverse reaction, and if you think I am willing to risk that again to my kid in order to make you another parent feel safer about your kid, you are seriously hallucinating.</p>

However, your statement is wrong.  You say “Unvaccinated children can not get vaccinated children sick. In fact getting the vaccine is not a guarantee that the person won’t get the measles!”</p>
<p>Well, if vaccinated children can still get the measles (from your second sentence), then certainly it is true that unvaccinated children (if they do have the measles) CAN potentially get vaccinated children sick.  </p>
<p>The real issue is just how likely that is, and how bad is it if it should happen.  I think the real numbers show that the answers to both of those questions are the same:  “not very”.</p>

Of course, you being “a pediatrician” is of no importance to me.  My children had the mmr vaccines……they both got terrible ill from it.  And they both contracted measles some time later.  My niece almost died from the vaccine and went into seizures.  I think parents need to get all the information they can, from many different sources, and make an informed decision.  I would NOT have my children vaccinated today.  You talk about “parents who choose not to vaccinate their children should be sued for potential harm they cause by spreading a vaccine preventable disease to say a child with leukemia”…..well, if you’ll see who will be sued if the government tries to force parents to vaccinate their children.  You know nothing about the decisions informed parents make.  You don’t have the right to belittle parents for any choice.  Measles is a benign disease and many of us took our children around to kids of our friends so they could get it and be done with it.  If your child gets measles, keep them down so the measles come out.  That’s what my parents did.  I stayed in a darkened room and ate lots of fruit, drank lots of water and waited until they passed.  And yes, we had cod liver oil.  Parents can still use common sense, as they did, as we did back then.  Use your common sense and don’t be bullied by this so called pediatrician!</p>

You are an idiot. Most parents that choose not to vaccinate are far more educated than those that blindly follow arrogant health care providers like yourself. Please educate yourself, get your head out of your butt, and learn more about your patients .<br>
Peds like you make me sick. You are the reason so many parents dispise the medical model.<br>
If you truly want to help people and make a difference, try getting to know your patients and going over the best possible options for that patient, rather than threatening, manipulating, and scaring parents into choices you think are best. If you truly cared, and truly listened to parents, they would appreciate the advice you give. Prideful, arrogant health care providers turn away so many *educated* parents, not a lack of information.<br>
I hope you learn to have an open mind before you turn away any more parents coming to you for help.<br>

However, how many of the cases of measles in the US or worldwide are in fact measles. Studies have been done demonstrating that when ‘measles’ cases diagnosed by doctors are laboratory tested the majority are caused by other viruses and not measles at all. As soon as a vaccine is introduced, e.g. polio, the doctors decide that symptoms that previously were one disease must be another.(e.g. aseptic meningitis). We have to work with the statistics given in order to present a rational argument but often I wonder if we are not just playing with numbers which bear little relation to reality.</p>

All within a 2 year period. I spent a lot of time home sick from school. But I survived. As did all of my friends who contracted the same diseases in the 1960’s before immunizations. </p>
<p>I am also much of the opinion that the tragic deaths that did occur were not solely due to the viruses, but underlying disease as well. Malnutrition and all of the problems that accompany that were biggies in the Southern US at that time.</p>

I was born in 1952 – one of five children all born between 1947 and 1957.  Like some of the comments above, we all had measles, mumps, chicken pox, german measles, as did our cousins, friends, classmates, etc. and all recovered without complications. It was just a normal part of childhood back then.  I do remember that my mom made us take cod liver oil regularly.  Mom was instinctively very wise and we also had a pediatrician named Dr. Fish!  When I was preparing to have my third daughter in 1988 and the vaccine schedule was on the rise, I began to do my own research on the pros and cons of “routine” vaccines.  Part of my research included talking with older moms who raised their children in the pre-vaccine area.  The consensus was that although it kept the moms and kids in the house for a while — especially in cases like ours where two would get the illness, followed by the next two and then the fifth child — it really wasn’t a big deal and our moms were not afraid of these illnesses.  While parents of today are conditioned to be terrified of the once routine acute childhood diseases which came with the side benefit of lifelong immunity; traditional medicine has conditioned today’s parents to accept the chronic childhood diseases of ear infections, allergies, ADD/ADHD, Asthma, Autism, etc., and the drugs to treat them — which come with lifelong side effects — as the new “normal”.</p>

I applaud your proactive stance regarding the “routine” vaccines, and completely agree with your observations on the complacency and acceptance of chronic illness in children as “the new normal.” Vaccinations have destroyed our kids immune systems and robbed them of the right to strengthen and develop immunity by fighting off childhood illnesses.</p>

I completely agree with you in that, “Those who have weakened immune systems, other ailments, or are malnourished need things like improved nutrition, improved sanitation and clean water.”  </p>
<p>It’s not easy to be a parent, but as parents, it is our responsibility to be informed — to learn as much as we can about the pros and cons when it comes to vaccines, foods, exposure to toxins, medical treatments and anything that affects the health of our children — and then we should have the right to choose what we truly believe is best for our children.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard Paul Offiit, MD say in a video, with regard to parents who choose not to vaccinate, that, “some parents don’t do what’s best for their children.”  What an awful statement!!!</p>
<p>My older daughters, born in 1978 and 1980 received the handful of vaccines that were recommended at that time.  To be honest, I hadn’t done any research back then.  I just did what the doctor said was best for my children and thought, “Wow, I won’t have to deal with what my mother did!”  I should have known better . . . those routine childhood diseases of yesteryear actually had some benefits that I enjoy having had the natural illnesses, but my daughters do not.</p>
<p>As I wrote in my previous message, when I was pregnant with my youngest in 1988 and vaccines were on the rise, I started my research — not to prove that vaccines were harmful — but to make an informed choice either way and do what was truly best for my baby.  I can still remember how painful and disturbing it was to learn from that research which included “mainstream” and “alternative” sources about the adverse effects of vaccines; about the incredibly sad stories of children that had been seriously harmed from vaccines; and, keep in mind,  that was before we had the epidemics of Autism, Allergies, Asthma, ADD/ADHD that we have today.  In addition, when my older daughters were vaccinated, I had been led to believe that vaccines offered lifelong immunity to Pertussis, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, etc.  It wasn’t until years later that we heard, “oops”  the immunity doesn’t last . . . “looks like we need booster shots.”  As a result of all that research, which continues to this day, I made different choices for my youngest daughter.</p>
<p>With all due respect, Tom, vaccines are not “extremely low risk.”  If they were, and diseases could safely be eliminated, I doubt that parents would oppose them.  No mother wants to see her child — or any child —  suffer or die; and I’m sure most mothers don’t want to be confined to the house while their children are sick!  The parents that I know who oppose vaccines are educated, well informed, loving, caring people who only want the truth and what is best for children — all children.  They are people who have done their homework on these issues before making their decision.  I know from personal experience that it is not easy to make a choice that goes against against mainstream opinion, “authorities” and conventional medicine.  </p>
<p>I now find myself in a situation where my youngest daughter — now 25 — must submit to vaccines for MMR and Tetanus to start law school on a part time basis.  She will not be living on campus or in a dormitory, but attending class 4 hours a night, 4 nights per week with about 35 adult students — she is probably one of the youngest.  The school is in an urban setting very close to the office in which she currently works. If she takes more than 12 credits, which she may have to do next year, she will be required to have a Hep B shot as well.  Up until now, we were considered “exempt” for philosophical reasons which were honored in the same way as a religious exemption; however, philosophical exemptions are being eliminated at the state level and it appears that religious and even medical exemptions are being compromised. Anyone concerned about the elimination of our right to choose should go to <a href="http://www.nvic.org/NVIC-Vaccine-News/May-2014/NVIC-Calls-for-Vaccine-Policy---Law-Reform--To-Pro.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.nvic.org/NVIC-Vaccine-News/May-2014/NVIC-Calls-for-Vaccine-Policy—Law-Reform–To-Pro.aspx</a>, watch the video, download the guide to “Reforming Vaccine Policy and Law” and learn about the NVIC Advocacy Portal.</p>
<p>If anyone has experience with an adult child being forced to get vaccines, I would appreciate your input.  Thank you very much!   God bless all the young children and adult children — vaccinated or not — and the parents who love them.</p>

It is likely that since more than six months have passed that you and your daughter have already made a decision regarding her forced vaccination; however, I feel compelled to respond.  I received forced vaccinations from my university, and I didn’t fight it because at the time I didn’t know how, nor did I realize the severity of what would come.  I had a life-altering reaction to the vaccine I was given and it has caused multiple medical problems in my life, including but not limited to blackouts and migraine headaches that I had never before experienced.  In addition, I also developed a severe, life-threatening allergy to many of the ingredients that were in the vaccine, including things as simple as gelatin.  I was informed by my physician afterwards that if I ever receive another vaccine, it could kill me.  In fact, in my family, in my generation, 1/3 of us have had life-altering reactions to vaccines.  Mine was the mildest. If you are deciding whether to get the vaccine or not, I strongly suggest you check the vaccine’s side effects and determine for yourself whether the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>

It’s good to hear the other side the story.  It becomes difficult to listen to the hysteria online and in the news.  So many more children die from gun violence, the flu and other diseases.

I guess having an extremely low risk way to prevent children from dying is not worth thinking about if it only saves poor kids. I am not sure why people would be so arrogantly flippant about the prevention of such diseases as measles, rubella, polio, rabies, small pox, and tetanus (all seriously dangerous diseases whose ill effects have been greatly reduced or eradicated by vaccination); I think it is, ironically, that the reduction brought about by vaccination has given people a comfort zone where they do not feel such things a threat and can thus poo-poo the value of vaccines. In 1980, prior to the worldwide prevalence of a cheap and available measles vaccine worldwide, there were 2.6 million deaths due to measles; widespread vaccination has reduced this to 122,000 in 2012. Hey but we’re talking about 6 billion people on earth, so who cares about 2.5 million additional preventable deaths each year, especially since they are mostly poor kids, and people with other health problems, right?</p>

They certainly should not be vaccinated, as it clearly states on the vaccine-manufacturer’s inserts.<br>
You are incorrect on many levels. For example, tetanus is a bacterial illness that is not transmittable from human-to-human. There is also no evidence that the vaccine does anything to protect against tetanus. Actually, there is no evidence vaccines have had ANY effect on the eradication of illness. If you look at the graphs for diseases in developed countries, all of them have decreased in morbidity and mortality at very similar rates, regardless of whether or not there is a corresponding vaccine. In all cases, for those illnesses that do have a corresponding vaccine, the vaccine was developed and released at a very late state in the decline of incidence and severity. People who push vaccines often make the statement “correlation does not equal causation” when it comes to vaccines and autism. You can’t have it both ways. If you believe vaccines have eradicated illness, prove it. Correlation does not equal causation. And for the record… smallpox was absolutely not eradicated by vaccination. Smallpox was endemic world-wide for centuries, dating back to at least the time of the pharaohs in Egypt. Less than 10% of the world’s population was vaccinated against smallpox. If, as vaccinators claim, we have to have 90-95% vaccine-coverage to eradicate disease and to keep it from coming back, please explain how vaccines could have possibly stopped smallpox. Also, since we now know that the pertussis vaccine wears off in 3-5 years’ time, and since at least 50% of the population (adults) walking around have not been vaccinated in decades and we have not had huge resurgence of whooping cough (except in cases where the vaccine is spreading it by promoting colonization of B. parapertussis in the lungs of recipients), how exactly does that fit in with the concept of “herd-immunity?” It doesn’t, because there is no such thing as “vaccine-induced herd immunity.”  Herd immunity is a concept that is only applicable to naturally-acquired immunity. If you want me to believe there is such a thing as “vaccine-induced herd immunity,” please show me the research article(s) that prove it.</p>

It’s also a odds game.  We are seeing in real time currently the effects of what happens when vaccination rates drop on the westside of Los Angeles.  There are a lot of complications like deafness and blindness that are proven to be caused by measles, unlike autism and vaccines.  Every ingredient in vaccines also has a purpose… And have been proven harmless in the quantities found in vaccines.  They may have scary names, but You probably inhale worse things for your body on a daily basis just breathing be air in Los Angeles.</p>

I care deeply about children around the world.  It is far more effective to clean up their water, give them better nutrition and living conditions, and increase their access to medical care, because these things help protect them from ALL diseases.  Vaccination can certainly be part of the solution, but it’s not the sole route to good health.  I believe the comments about only children in the third world dying of measles were to point out that there is a different cost-benefit analysis for American kids.  If measles was deadly in this country, perhaps a small risk of neurological damage would be worth it.  The reason it it not deadly, as has been shown, has nothing to do with vaccination.</p>

I’m in my mid-fifties. Virtually everyone I knew growing up had measles, mumps, and chicken pox. It was very rare not to. I have lived for 54 years without meeting ONE SINGLE PERSON who has ever mentioned any long term detrimental effects from one of these diseases, nor have they mentioned knowing anyone with long term detrimental effects. My life experience is not a peer reviewed medical study, but if these are so dangerous, why are deaths, complications, or any effect whatsoever so unknown among people alive during the era of these illnesses being a normal part of childhood?</p>
<p>Polio crippled people and some died from paralyzed muscles involved in breathing. Pertussis killed the toddler daughter of one of my great-aunts, without her having any weaknesses or risk factors. It still kills some people, although it’s a tiny fraction of those who get it. Smallpox scarred people, caused blindness, and had a fairly high mortality rate. It makes sense to vaccinate for these disease, because they can be dangerous. (However, there are documented dangers with the vaccines, as well as evidence that vaccines are either no longer needed, weren’t the cause of the decline of these illnesses, etc. discussed elsewhere.) </p>
<p>Measles, mumps, and chicken pox don’t belong in the same category as these diseases. Calling these “dangerous” is being melodramatic.</p>
<p>In addition, your insinuation that people against vaccinations don’t care about poor people also misses the mark. People of all socioeconomic levels develop other ailments, have compromised immune systems, and those with anorexia have self-induced malnutrition.</p>

Like other posters of my generation have mentioned…in all my 59 years, I have met 2 people that were affected by polio, and one who sustained partial deafness from measles (but he also had scarlet fever too at about the same time, so who knows?) but no others whose family, friends, or associates claim lasting injury or death from the aforementioned illnesses.</p>

We are obviously distrustful of those sites, especially since the the long-term fraud in the Vaccine Safety Research group at the CDC, and the cover-up of said fraud by the IOM have come to light. Please see Dr. William Thompson’s published statement, released by his attorney (one of the most prestigious “whistleblower” experts in the U.S.) on August 27, 2014. You can read that here:  <a href="http://www.morganverkamp.com/august-27-2014-press-release-statement-of-william-w-thompson-ph-d-regarding-the-2004-article-examining-the-possibility-of-a-relationship-between-mmr-vaccine-and-autism/" rel="nofollow">http://www.morganverkamp.com/august-27-2014-press-release-statement-of-william-w-thompson-ph-d-regarding-the-2004-article-examining-the-possibility-of-a-relationship-between-mmr-vaccine-and-autism/</a></p>
<p>At this point in time, I am actively working to bring the CDC’s fraud and the harm it has caused to the attention of the American public. We are pushing for a complete investigation of the CDC’s vaccine research and the cover-up, which has resulted in untold numbers of children being harmed or killed in the last 20+ years. I do not have the time to review spam, which is what you are doing. Peddle it somewhere else, please.</p>

<p>Imagine the ethical and legal implications if “vaxtruth.org” were held to the same standard if, say, after the next round of measles and other outbreaks, someone pointed to the misinformation presented and counter evidence intentionally omitted from this web site as the reason they did not vaccinate their children who subsequently suffered or died from completely preventable diseases.</p>
<p>With respect to the DeStefano paper and Thomson’s involvement, please note that this was a study of highly limited scope (&lt;600 male African American children in the Atlanta area), subject to highly questionable reanalysis which has since been retracted by the journal in which it was published: <a href="http://www.translationalneurodegeneration.com/content/3/1/16" rel="nofollow">http://www.translationalneurodegeneration.com/content/3/1/16</a>, and suffers from a complete lack of repeatability in the many subsequent studies carried out since then by many groups both in the US and internationally, most completely unaffiliated with the CDC.</p>
<p>Frankly, you should be ashamed for not publishing legitimate comments on your site on both sides of such an important discussion. Each of my entries were respectful, fact-based, and simply questioned the factual and procedural integrity of the observations both included in and omitted from your articles about measles. My references to the CDC, for example, were limited to sites that a) describe complications of measles (which can be found on any number of medical sites), and b) incidence and death rate statistics which the articles themselves refer to. Which of these exactly contains the "fraud" and "cover-up" to which you allude?</p>

<p>Truth will speak for itself, but editing and redacting Adam’s comments and replacing them instead with a list of links to support your side of the argument shows your lack of faith in people… in their ability to read and understand and (if needed) discredit Adam’s links. Your heavy handed redaction of his posts (calling them spam as a veiled justification for doing so) is reprehensible. It is a sad irony that you resort to such repressive techniques to avoid alternate viewpoints.</p>
<p>In your post, you wrote, “Directing people to receive information from Paul Offit at CHOP is not something I would ever do.” By allowing Adam to post his links, you are not directing people to anything. You are allowing people to share and explore ideas. If you’re convinced that Adam’s links are to worthless drivel, reply and say so…. but to outright delete them and silence his voice is appalling.</p>

You need to find someone else to target with your need for attention.</p>
<p>From Adam:</p>
<p>“Marcella: I’m very confused. If you read my comments before deleting them, you know just as well as I do that not one of them contained a single link to Paul Offit or CHOP. I don’t know if you still have access to the text, but I do have copies of each that I could repost if you are willing to allow that.</p>
<p>[My response:  Please refer to Adam’s comment above and to the links he provided, the first of which is to CHOP.]</p>
<p>Back to Adam:</p>
<p>Here is a brief summary of each post that I made, first to this article ‘Putting Measles into Perspective’ (5 posts):<br>
-I posted a full list of complications from measles with incidence data from the CDC pinkbook<br>
[link: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html</a></p>
<p>-I posted the conclusion from a review article that describes double-blind controlled tests of measles vaccines in low-middle income countries that prove the vaccine lowers neonatal mortality<br>
[Which has nothing to do with measles in the United States.]</p>
<p>-I posted a message pointing out the main severe complication of measles is pneumonia, which is why people don’t often think of measles itself being fatal<br>
[Which is why measles has not been a source of concern in the United States since the 1930s when antibiotics became available.]</p>
<p>-I posted that measles can be particular bad for pregnant women due to complications involving premature labor, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and low-birthweight infants<br>
[Which is why it is much more preferable for children to get measles naturally, as most did in early childhood prior to the mass vaccination program. This gave them long-lasting immunity, possibly life-long, and protected women throughout their pregnancies and also provided immunity to offspring during the first year of life. The vaccine often fails, with primary vaccine failure – giving no protection, and secondary vaccine failure – waning immunity after 5-25 years, leaving women with a false sense of security and zero protection when they need it most.]</p>
<p>-I posted the list of links to stories of people whose lives were affected (and sometimes ended) by measles, which you did post</p>
<p>The remainder of my comments were posted to your article ‘Measles at DIsneyland!’ (5 posts):<br>
-I pointed out that from 2000-2010, there were 8 deaths from measles in the US out of 777 cases, so an average risk of about 1 in 100 for those that actually catch measles.<br>
[What you don’t say is that at least some of those cases of measles are the result of the vaccine (vaccine-strain measles has been identified in several cases and horizontal transmission (aka “shedding”) does occur, particularly among people who are immune compromised, which may be why the death rate would be higher. The increase in measles cases over the last several years was predicted by scientists at the time of the development and mass use of the vaccine, due to concerns about both primary and secondary vaccine-failure. What we are seeing can be expected to continue and increase – not due to unvaccinated children, but as a result of the vaccine program.]</p>
<p>-Another comment asked to compare the risk of being struck by lightning and dying in a car accident to that of dying from measles; I posted the figures and references for each.<br>
[I don’t know how to respond to that because it seems irrelevant.]</p>
<p>-I made a post arguing that the risk of dying once someone actually caught measles (1 in 100 based on recent data) was a much more significant figure than the figure you calculate in your article, i.e., the risk of death from measles for any US citizen.<br>
[Use of third-world statistics to fear-monger regarding measles in the United States does not deserve a response.]</p>
<p>-I posted that the risk of death of 1 in 1000 prior to the vaccine in 1963 was accurate based on reported cases, but that the common assumption was that many cases were not reported prior to the vaccine being available.<br>
[With 3-4 million cases of measles per year (U.S.) and an average death rate of 450 per year in the U.S., the 1/1000 figure is complete bullshit. Again, using third-world stats to fear-monger does not deserve a response.]</p>
<p>-I posted that while measles-related deaths in the US were going away prior to the vaccine (primarily due to improved treatment of pneumonia), measles cases were not decreasing until the vaccine was introduced in 1963 (and the number of cases dropped by 20X, and deaths by a further 10X). These data were omitted from Figure 1 in the article.<br>
[There is no “Figure 1″ in the article. If you are referring to Dawn’s article, that is something you should take up with her. As I told you and as is clearly stated, she does not write for VaxTruth and her article was reposted here with permission. If you contact her and receive a response, I would be happy to post that in the comments on this site.<br>
My own response to your comment is, “Why are we trying to prevent measles in the first place, since it is not a serious infection in children (when it occurs naturally and for a very important reason)? As my more recent article “Measles is GOOD for YOU? conveys, the attempt at wiping out measles and other mild childhood infections was misguided and it now appears that the artificial manipulation and tamping down of the natural immune system, may be a contributing factor to the higher incidences of childhood cancers. Given that measles (and mumps) infections are protective against cancer, and given that the MMR vaccine has been shown to alter DNA in recipients via homologous recombinant DNA from aborted fetal cell lines, and given that childhood cancers are associated with alterations in DNA in early childhood, why would we want to continue this insane practice?]</p>
<p>I reiterate, none of these posts included any link or mention of Paul Offit or CHOP in any way.<br>
[I reiterate, see the post (1 of 11) I published, higher up in this thread and see the first link contained there.]</p>

What a crock of BS.  This is the most asinine argument against vaccinations I have ever seen.  Obviously the author has no concept that every statistic represents heartbroken, grieving people who lost someone they didn’t have to lose.  It wouldn’t cheer me up, if my son died of the measles, to think that after all, he’s only a small statistic, so nobody will miss him anyway.  I’D miss him!!!!! And it wouldn’t matter if he was the ONLY death from measles on the planet!  I’d miss him with all my heart and I would never forgive myself for choosing not to protect him from a disease when I could have.  BUT I DID PROTECT HIM.  Damn right I did.  There are things I can’t protect him from, but this is one thing he will never suffer from!</p>

A few cases of measles is a crisis used to spread fear and panic.  Children die from severe vaccine reactions and it doesn’t even make the local news, isn’t allowed to be mentioned in the obituary, they don’t get a purple heart for their sacrifice for the herd and our family is not honored or even recognized for our sacrifice.  No indeed, it is quite the opposite.  We are shunned, marginalized, accused of being delusional money-grubbing, uneducated, looking for something to blame.  Even if awarded in vaccine court we are told by online trolls it still doesn’t mean it was related.  They tell us serious reaction happen they will just never acknowledge one EVER!<br>
Children die, it’s the worst thing any human being will ever experience no more, no less whether from a typically benign childhood illness, or from vaccines, accidents, food poisoning,  or any other reason.  Do you really believe if people would just vaccinate no children would ever die again.  It’s also tragic when a perfectly healthy child regresses right before their parents’ eyes following a vaccine reaction!<br>
Please save your fake indignation for someone else!  I would give up my own life, pay millions of dollars just to go back in time and give my children the opportunity to take their chances with the measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, hell I would take our chances with polio verses what we have gone through!</p>

You have no right to say I don’t really mean what I say.  I mean every word of it.  Saying that risking children’s deaths from disease is a valid option because the odds are so minimal is insensitive and stupid.  My son has a kidney disorder and I have spend days with him in the hospital watching him suffer something I couldn’t prevent.  I am just thankful he has never had to suffer from something I could have protected him from and CHOSE NOT TO.  I am from a generation that was vaccinated as a matter of course and I have never in my life met anyone who had an adverse reaction to it, or had a loved one die from a vaccination.  I have however met a few people from an older generation who had polio and the usual childhood diseases and it’s not an experience they want to repeat.  I’ll take the one in a million chance that my son will have a negative reaction to a vaccine over the 540 out of 150,000 chance that he could be hospitalized for a preventable disease.  If we’re just out to play the odds with our children, that sounds like a lot better odds to me.  There are valid reasons not to vaccinate, but saying that the numbers show that the few deaths from measles don’t matter because they are so minimal in comparison to all deaths is not one of them.</p>

The original purpose for posting the deaths from measles as compared to other reasons for death was just to show that the media, and CDC are overstating the seriousness of the disease, not to say that a death from one cause is more or less traumatic than any other.  And, what the other response to your seemed to be saying is that a child can just as easily die or become permanently disabled from the vaccine as from the disease.  Just because you personally don’t know anyone this happened to, doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen.  The government has paid out millions to vaccine injured children.  So, you choose to take your risk with the vaccine, and we choose to take our risk with the disease.  It’s really that simple.</p>

It’s about the GREATER good, right?  And, your argument in this post is often MY argument, but on the other side.  If your child goes from a normal, healthy, developing child to a state of regression or permanent health issues from any of the numerous side effects listed in the vaccine inserts themselves, would YOU care if those side effects were rare?  And, if you think that serious side effects DON’T occur from vaccines, read the inserts, or better yet do a little search to find out how much the government has paid out to the families of injured children.  And, incidentally, it cheapens an argument on either side when you assume something ridiculous like that anyone who cares enough about this issue to waste valuable time arguing about it is so insensitive that they don’t care about children dying.  We will never come to a common ground by hurling such accusations.</p>

I empathize with the fact that they sincerely believe they are protecting their children and endeavor to keep that in mind when discussions become passion-filled. I wonder if they know they can request single shots that specifically do not contain glyphosate or aluminum or if they are not even given the option or the option to space them out. There are so many unknowns and injuries that should be addressed and are being ignored in the name of “real science”, while injured numbers increase. The many beautiful baby pictures I’ve see of children who passed soon after their immunizations and the heartbreaking stories that accompany them make me extremely grateful my children are grown and were fortunate enough to have vaccine schedules greatly reduced from what is now considered normal. They both had the chicken pox so hopefully won’t let anyone talk them into having that shot. I have a couple of dear friends whose children survived, but whose lives have been irrevocably altered. It’s truly heartbreaking.</p>

They cited distrust in vaccinations and objections to mandatory vaccination of themselves and children as factors contributing to their decision to leave nursing. Here is a link to the study:  <a href="http://www.vaccineliberationarmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/What-lies-behind-the-low-rate-of-immuniz-among-nurses.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.vaccineliberationarmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/What-lies-behind-the-low-rate-of-immuniz-among-nurses.pdf</a></p>

There is so much out there (on both sides) that is absolute bosh, that it’s hard to make an actual informed decision.  I vaccinated because I hadn’t even heard of the anti vaccination movement until it was already a done deal.  I would have vaccinated anyway.  I completely and with my whole heart believe that doing what was in my power to protect my son from disease was the best choice. When he became seriously ill (from something completely unrelated to any vaccine) his immune system was compromised by the drugs he had to take.  He got sick at the drop of a hat, 9 sinus infections in one year, and countless sniffles and coughs.  All I could think was how thankful I was that he couldn’t get whooping cough and measles and all the rest. There is no doubt in my mind that with his weakened system he would have died from a disease like that. That’s my gut.  You have to go with yours.  I applaud you for doing your best to make an educated decision for the well being of your children.  Keep researching, but with an open mind to both sides.  Bear in mind that the generation of people trying to convince everyone that suffering through a disease is no big deal, is NOT the generation that did suffer through these diseases.  That generation is still here to give you their 2 cents.  Talk to people who’ve experienced having those diseases and ask them if they’d rather not have had them. My mom still remembers hallucinating and feeling absolutely horrible with chicken pox and that was over 50 years ago.  People blame vaccinations for autism, but has incidence of autism declined with the decline of vaccinations?  I don’t see either side looking into that. Good luck with your continued research.</p>

There has been no decline in vaccinations.<br>
In 1983, children vaccinated according to the CDC’s schedule received 23 vaccines between 2 months of age and 18 years of age.<br>
In 2014, children vaccinated according to the CDC’s schedule received 26 vaccines by six months of age; 49 by 6 years, and 70 by 18 years.<br>

<p>In the 1980s, the rate of autism in the U.S. was 1 in 10,000 children.<br>
In 2014, the CDC announced the rate was 1 in 68 among 12 year-olds. Extrapolating the data, that means the current rate is 1 in 21 among 3 year-olds; 1 in 18 among 2 year-olds.</p>

I refer to the exploding numbers of people opting out of vaccines, not to the vaccine schedules. My question is: since huge numbers of parents are no longer vaccinating their children for fear of autism, has autism declined? Has anyone researched this?  Since the anti vax movement we have seen outbreaks of diseases that were almost unheard of in my childhood. QED, there is a decline in vaccinations.  Is there a corresponding decline in autism diagnoses???</p>

It is also not true that “fear of autism” is the only or even the main reason people choose not to vaccinate. The percentage of people who vaccinate remains above 95% in most places of the country. There are only a very few places where vaccination rates have fallen below that level. And no. there has been no decline in autism. The rate of autism has increased by approximately 15,000% since the early 1980s, when it was 1 in 10,000.</p>

The research you refer to was not a research study investigating vaccines; it was the report of Dr. Wakefield’s observations in children he was seeing for gastrointestinal disease at the Royal Free Hospital in the U.K.  Dr. Wakefield saw, among the many children in the study, that a number of children with developmental delays and/or autism diagnoses appeared to have a different form of bowel disease. The parents of those children reported that their children had developed the bowel disease after the MMR vaccine, and then regressed and some of them (not all) were then diagnosed with autism.<br>
In the original paper, Dr. Wakefield reported what he observed, and as is the case in all good research, he stated that further inquiry appeared to be warranted.<br>
There is a huge amount of conflict-of-interest in what became the witch-hunt to discredit Dr. Wakefield.<br>
This is a good article which explains the ties between Brian Deer, James Murdoch, the Sunday Times, and GlaxoSmithKline (makers of the MMR vaccine):  <a href="http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2011/07/revisiting-james-murdoch-brian-deer.html" rel="nofollow">http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2011/07/revisiting-james-murdoch-brian-deer.html</a></p>
<p>The media still points to Dr. Wakefield whenever anyone talks about autism and vaccines. The problem with that is that Dr. Wakefield’s paper was ONLY about the MMR vaccine. MMR is only a tiny part of the overall vaccination schedule administered to infants and children. When people say vaccines have been studied, that is inaccurate. Infants vaccinated according to the 2014 CDC Vaccination Schedule receive 26 vaccines by 6 months of age; 49 by six years, and 70 by the age of 18. The schedule has never been studied for safety or efficacy. When people take their infants in for 2, 4, 6, and 12 month “well-baby checkups,” those infants receive between 8-10 vaccines all at once. That has never been studied. What happens in each of those appointments is completely experimental. There has never been a governmental study comparing health outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated children. That study has been done in other countries, with the result that unvaccinated children are far healthier.</p>
<p>Here is a link to testimony from the Congressional Hearing on Autism, held in November 2012:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA9f-i0LKaU" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA9f-i0LKaU</a><br>
Here is a link for studies comparing vaccinated vs. unvaccinated health outcomes:  <a href="http://www.vaxchoicevt.com/science/studies-comparing-vaccinated-to-unvaccinated-populations/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vaxchoicevt.com/science/studies-comparing-vaccinated-to-unvaccinated-populations/</a></p>
<p>This is a good link to a list compiled by Ginger Taylor, which now includes 96 studies that show how vaccines can and do cause autism:  <a href="http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/06/no-evidence-of-any-link.html" rel="nofollow">http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/06/no-evidence-of-any-link.html</a></p>
<p>Getting back to Dr. Wakefield’s research, contrary to what the media tells you, that research has been replicated in at least 28 studies performed in several different countries. You can learn more about those studies here: <a href="http://currenthealthscenario.blogspot.com/2012/06/28-studies-that-support-dr-andrew.html" rel="nofollow">http://currenthealthscenario.blogspot.com/2012/06/28-studies-that-support-dr-andrew.html</a></p>
<p>Even the studies that have been performed for the express purpose of discrediting Dr. Wakefield’s work have actually found the same association between MMR vaccine, bowel disease, and autism. This was one of those studies, which I broke down paragraph by paragraph to show the deception:  <a href="http://vaxtruth.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Only-5-of-251-final.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://vaxtruth.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Only-5-of-251-final.pdf</a></p>
<p>This is a presentation I put together Vaccines: Questions &amp; Answers:  <a href="http://vaxtruth.org/2014/12/4196/" rel="nofollow">http://vaxtruth.org/2014/12/4196/</a></p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to the proof that vaccines cause autism, all you have to really do is listen to the experts on the subject: the parents who are left to care for their children for the rest of their lives. I hope you will take the time to listen to their stories and to really see their children.<br>

It’s on the news, there are documentaries about the trend.  There is the fact of the existence of this and other websites (dedicated to convincing large numbers of parents not to vaccinate) and the fact that until 15 years ago I didn’t know anyone who didn’t vaccinate and now I know many parents who are refusing vaccinations, ALL support the understanding that there is in fact an explosion in the numbers of people refusing to vaccinate.  It is evident in the fact that there are large outbreaks of diseases that my generation never had to think about.  You can’t possibly assert that the people now suffering from these diseases have all been vaccinated?  If that was the case, it would be all over the news that the vaccines had failed and that new ones were being manufactured and we should all go get the updated vaccine.  No, the disease is spreading among the unvaccinated population.  Therefore I know, in spite of your assertion, that numbers of vaccinated children have certainly declined sharply.  But thank you for the information that, in spite of this, autism continues to rise.   I’d be interested to know what the incidence of autism is among the unvaccinated population, and if the percentages are comparable to incidence among the vaccinated population.</p>

Goals were for 90% coverage for individual vaccines and 80% for full series. The first link below is for data from 2000-2007. The second link is for 2013. As you can see, there has been no decrease in vaccination rates. The rates are the highest they have ever been in most areas of the country.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19524616" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19524616</a><br>
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/immunize.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/immunize.htm</a></p>
<p>What you see on the news and in the documentaries (especially if you are referring to the NOVA series, which is funded by Merck), is a targeted attempt to fear-monger and turn parents against each other. If you believe what you hear on news stations that receive millions of dollars in funding from pharmaceutical companies, then you need to re-evaluate the sources from which you are receiving your “news.” Count the number of pharmaceutical commercials during the next national newscast.</p>
<p>As for large outbreaks of diseases your generation never had to think about… The overuse of vaccines is causing many of the outbreaks. This is very easy to understand if you dig deep into the research on pertussis. If you care about the truth, I hope you will take the time to read this:  <a href="http://vaxtruth.org/2015/01/pertussis/" rel="nofollow">http://vaxtruth.org/2015/01/pertussis/</a></p>
<p>As for the incidence of autism in unvaccinated populations, we have information from the Amish Community: <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccine/olmsted.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.whale.to/vaccine/olmsted.html</a><br>
We also have the large population from HomeFirst Family Practice in Chicago, which is where my recently departed friend, Dr. Mayer Eisenstein and his colleagues have been delivering babies and caring for children for more than 40 years. Dr. Eisenstein never gave a vaccine and he very rarely prescribed antibiotics. There were more than 50,000 children in the practice in the 4 decades of Dr. Eisenstein’s medical career, and the rate of autism was 1 in 25,000. That’s compared to the CDC’s rate announce in March 2014 of 1 in 68 among 12 year-olds. The CDC’s data has indicated a 13-15% yearly increase in autism since the 1990s. Extrapolating the data that means the current rate among 3 year-olds is 1 in 21 among U.S. children, with more than 90% of them being fully vaccinated, according to the CDC’s data. Most schools throughout the country report vaccination rates at 97-100%.<br>
There’s a big difference between 1 in 25,000 among vaccine-free children and 1 in 68 (or 1 in 21) among those who are so highly vaccinated.</p>

I had measle 5 times, yes 5, without any problems whatsoever. I also had chicken pox, mumps and German measles all without incident as did most people of my generation. As others have mentioned here, I never ever heard of anyone suffering complications or dying from any of these diseases. Not to mention, things such as peanut allergies were also unheard of. We used to take peanut butter sandwiches to school without a problem. It is a fact that these illnesses help build a child’s immune system, whereas vaccines will destroy it. I can’t believe how so many seemingly intelligent people can be swept up in the scaremongering hype caused by big Pharmaceutical companies peddling their dangerous products. No-one was scared of these illnesses when I was growing up, it was a normal part of childhood. For someone to inject these toxins into a tiny baby equates to child abuse in my eyes. I would much rather see a child with measles and building a healthy immune system than suffer the possible consequences of these unproven and unsafe vaccines that have caused numerous deaths and disabilities. Do some proper research. It’s also been shown that the majority of SIDS deaths occur within days of a child being vaccinated, sometimes hours. Coincidence? That’s what they try to tell you. Who had ever heard of SIDS or cot death prior to vaccines becoming mainstream? Vaccines are not even effective at protecting a child from these diseases anyway, as a large number that contract the diseases are those that have been vaccinated. Why put your child at risk with something that doesn’t work anyway? Give me another dose of measles anyday.</p>

I know what it’s like to have a chronically ill child. I would never wish that on anyone.<br>
There is a good chance, particularly if you and your son were vaccinated, that you did not get pertussis from a vaccine-free person. You may have gotten it from the vaccine, or from someone else who was recently vaccinated. This post explains how, and it is backed up with research citations.<br>

We got it from someone who was also fully vaxxed.  Because we had all been vaccinated, we were all out spreading germs for months, thinking it could never be whooping cough.  In our case, the vaccination led to our faulty thinking, which caused the disease to spread.  So it seems silly to blame the 5% of kids who haven’t had a DTaP, in my view.</p>

You said “My son and I got Whooping Cough due to anti-vaxxer morons”<br>
How did you determine the vector?<br>
Do you know beyond a reasonable doubt the source?<br>
You also acquired Whooping Cough?  You do not indicate you age, but I’m going to guess that you were born recently enough to have received the vaccine, if so, who did you get it?  Perhaps it was because the vaccine does not grant life time immunity?<br>
“My son  and I got…”  So, either he wasn’t vaccinated or the vaccine didn’t protect him.  Which was it?</p>

What about all the people you are around before you have symptoms and those who knowingly or out of ignorance while they do have symptoms?<br>
Those the most vulnerable are those with another illness that maybe completely curable had not some fool selfishly not received their vaccinations.  Or the ones that the vaccine did not take; with most vaccines this happens.<br>
The risks of the vaccine far out way the pain, deaths,  and permanent disabilities of not being vaccinated when applied the WHOLE population.  Ship of fools.</p>

Vaccines are tested on infants and children who are cleared medically and pronounced 100% healthy. They are then applied universally to the entire population of infants and children as if they are all the same. There is no other medical product or procedure that is deemed “safe” for 100% of the population. Serious vaccine injuries and vaccine-induced deaths do occur. When they do, parents are left holding the bag. The vaccine manufacturers are protected from liability by the U.S. government. Vaccines are the only product in existence that the government simultaneously mandates for use and refuses to protect consumers from harm.</p>

I know we are responsible for our own children’s health, and I am very thankful for that. I don’t ask other parents to protect my children. Why are we constantly being blamed for outbreaks? Why aren’t people upset that vaccines are not 100% effective? Why don’t some people ask why their child has cancer in the first place (hello, could it be vaccinations?).</p>

The father wanting to force unvaccinated children to never be allowed in school, as if SCHOOL is the ONLY place their cancer child could possibly get a disease.</p>
<p>“If we have the “right” to homeschool based on our own health decisions, this guy has the “right” to homeschool based on HIS, which is that he doesn’t want his children around the un-vaxx’d (and he does not get to make that decision for the rest of us).” – Ava Racc</p>
<p>I used to homeschool up until 3 years ago. It wasn’t because we didn’t vax, but now with the over blown hysteria over measles, it’s really pissing me off that people want a FEW to change their ways for one or two kids. Whole schools have to change their FOOD policies based on allergies to nuts. This is a benign request that doesn’t harm anyone on either end of the spectrum. Forcing medical chemicals into people who do not want them is possibly forcing harm onto them for another person’s irrational fears.</p>
<p>I fully believe both choices to vax or not have the same risks – side effects and death from both sides. Only one side risks treatable diseases, while the other risks injecting side effects and deaths. I’ll risk the measles with the complete minor  less than 1% chance of death over an unproved vaccine that has a 30% failure rate, any old day!</p>

I have 9 children. My oldest was born in 1998, and a few months before she was born there was a 20/20 episode that dealt with vaccine effectiveness, which started my questioning. I did a little bit of research (internet still young back then) and felt uncomfortable with it but in talking with my mother (had 6 kids) I decided to listen to her when she used the old statement “Well you were vaccinated, and you turned out fine.” At the time I didn’t have a comeback for it, I remember a few vaccines – one was in my butt as a kid and I HATED it and refused to sit in the car on the way home. I remember having chicken pox at one point too. No big deal.</p>
<p>So my oldest received vaccines for the first 2 years of her life. At about 6 months of age she had a febrile seizure – I won’t link vaccines to it but it was one of the scariest times in my life. </p>
<p>My 2nd child was born and we again vaccinated, until she was about 12mo old and at that point she received the MMR and from that vaccine got the measles! Her reaction to that vaccine changed my mind completely on the vaccine debate. </p>
<p>Vaccines had always been an inner debate of mine. It always felt WRONG to me when getting my babies vaccinated, and when baby #2 ended up with measles from the MMR we stopped cold turkey with vaccines. In high school, when I did a report on Autism and read about possible links to vaccinating and autism – especially in boys – I worried about it with my boys. I DO NOT automatically believe vaccines cause autism now. I believe they may trigger it, but that they are not the sole cause of autism. Still the idea of possibly vaccinating my children and them developing autism scared me, along with other side effects and death, especially after my 2nd’s reaction to the MMR.</p>
<p>Since then we have been vax free; even with birthing at home to make sure they don’t even get newborn injections.</p>
<p>My oldest was diagnosed with Expressive language disorder (she understands language but can not verbally express her thoughts ideas in an age appropriate manner) around age 4; my youngest who ended up with some medical complications shortly after birth was forced to have some vaccines (super long story) and he now, at age 2, is showing distinct signs that he too has expressive language disorder as well. My nephew who is 2 days older than my youngest and is on schedule for his vaccinations was recently diagnosed with recessive expressive language disorder (he can not understand information and language going in, nor can he express ideas and thoughts).</p>
<p>With our NOW family history of these language disorders in only vaccinated children, I do believe that vaccines may have contributed to these language disorders our children have now.</p>

Stop spouting hate-speech. That’s an idea.<br>
Given that the majority of the vaccines you are injecting into your tiny patients (assuming you are what you claim to be) have not been tested for their effect on fertility, and given that those vaccines are full of ingredients that are mutagenic and carcinogenic (look up the MSDS for each vaccine ingredient), there is a good probability that your wish will come true for a percentage of your patient population. And guess what? It will be your fault.<br>
Congratulations, Dr. Mengele.</p>

It is indeed interesting to read your “blog” and high end articles on your site (no question you are not in my office I don’t keep trash like this around). I especially found the article “vaccines don’t cause autism”enlightening. The cause and effect you so eloquently laid out must have been impressive to your readers. Indeed, I am a pediatrician and no I won’t “give you my “full name” as fanatical zealots such yourself would go to all ends to cause problems.  I myself was able to complete my schooling and, unlike you,am not struggling to pay back my loans. In the  environment In which I perform my duties,  I can’t specifically choose to see or not see a patient based on the uninformed, lack of evidence based decisions of their parents. The AAP does indeed recommend vaccination for all children as does the cdc and if I decide to not place my vaccinated patients or my chronically ill patients at risk by seeing your children then that is my prerogative. Go find another wacky pcp who you can push around with your far off ideas which have no root in western evidenced basedmedicine. There Is not some conspiracy theory as you would love your “readers” to believe as to why vaccines are important. Not that I need to (but I am somewhat amused by your reply) but I will address some of the questions you pose to me. First, yes I am vaccinated (including small pox) and yes you are correct that if i wasn’t it would put my patients at risk for things like pertusis and measles. I’m also sure that YOU are vaccinated as well and for the most part, you seem to be a functioning individual (no cure for stupidity). Also, being in the medical profession, I have never heard the term “vaccine related injuries”. Did you make that up just for your readers? Ohh my bizarre friend, I am indeed a pediatrician and I have saved many lives but as many that walk this planet now because of my interventions by far pale in comparison to those here because of vaccines.  It seems to me that you believe your “articles” are informative and empower your readers to make educated decisions but in fact, they do just the opposite. There is no end to the crap one can find on the Internet. Parents should be held responsible for preventable communicable diseases such as pertusis. They should be refused entry to schools and daycares in all circumstances. Keep up the good work.</p>

<p>ADVERSE REACTIONS</p>
<p>The following adverse reactions are listed in decreasing order of severity, without regard to causality, within each body system category and have been reported during clinical trials, with use of the marketed vaccine, or with use of monovalent or bivalent vaccine containing measles, mumps, or rubella:</p>
<p>Body as a Whole</p>
<p>Panniculitis; atypical measles; fever; syncope; headache; dizziness; malaise; irritability.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular System</p>
<p>Vasculitis.</p>
<p>Digestive System</p>
<p>Pancreatitis; diarrhea; vomiting; parotitis; nausea. </p>
<p>Endocrine System</p>
<p>Diabetes mellitus.</p>
<p>Hemic and Lymphatic System</p>
<p>Thrombocytopenia (see WARNINGS,Thrombocytopenia); purpura; regional lymphadenopathy;<br>
leukocytosis.</p>
<p>Immune System</p>
<p>Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported as well as related phenomena such as angioneurotic edema (including peripheral or facial edema) and bronchial spasm in individuals with or without an allergic history.</p>
<p>Musculoskeletal System</p>
<p>Arthritis; arthralgia; myalgia.<br>
Arthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), and polyneuritis are features of infection with wild-type<br>
rubella and vary in frequency and severity with age and sex, being greatest in adult females and least in prepubertal children. This type of involvement as well as myalgia and paresthesia, have also been reported following administration of MERUVAX II.<br>
Chronic arthritis has been associated with wild-type rubella infection and has been related to persistent virus and/or viral antigen isolated from body tissues. Only rarely have vaccine recipients developed chronic joint symptoms.<br>
Following vaccination in children, reactions in joints are uncommon and generally of brief duration.  In women, incidence rates for arthritis and arthralgia are generally higher than those seen in children (children: 0-3%; women: 12-26%),<br>
{17,56,57} and the reactions tend to be more marked and of longer duration. Symptoms may persist for a matter of months<br>
or on rare occasions for years.  In adolescent girls, the reactions appear to be intermediate in incidence between those seen in children and in adult women. Even in women older than 35 years, these reactions are generally well tolerated and rarely interfere with normal activities.</p>
<p>Nervous System</p>
<p>Encephalitis; encephalopathy; measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS); subacute<br>
sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE); Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS); acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM); transverse myelitis; febrile convulsions; afebri le convulsions or seizures; ataxia; polyneuritis; polyneuropathy; ocular palsies; paresthesia.</p>
<p>Experience from more than 80 million doses of all live measles vaccines given in the U.S. through 1975 indicates that significant central nervous system reactions such as encephalitis and encephalopathy, occurring within 30 days after<br>
vaccination, have been temporally associated with measles vaccine very rarely.{58} In no case has it been shown that reactions were actually caused by vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has pointed out that “a<br>
certain number of cases of encephalitis may be expected to occur in a large childhood population in a defined period of time even when no vaccines are administered”. However, the data suggest the possibility that some of these cases<br>
may have been caused by measles vaccines. The risk of such serious neurological disorders following live measles virus vaccine administration remains far less than that for encephalitis and encephalopathy with wild-type measles (one per two thousand reported cases).  Post-marketing surveillance of the more than 200 million doses of M-M-R and M-M-R II that have been distributed worldwide over 25 years (1971 to 1996) indicates that serious adverse events such as<br>
encephalitis and encephalopathy continue to be rarely reported.</p>
<p>Respiratory System</p>
<p>Pneumonia; pneumonitis (see CONTRAINDICATIONS); sore throat; cough; rhinitis.</p>
<p>Skin</p>
<p>Stevens-Johnson syndrome; erythema multiforme; urticaria; rash; measles-like rash; pruritis.</p>
<p>Local reactions including burning/stinging at injection site; wheal and flare; redness (erythema); swelling; induration; tenderness; vesiculation at injection site.</p>
<p>Special Senses — Ear</p>
<p>Nerve deafness; otitis media.</p>
<p>Special Senses — Eye</p>
<p>Retinitis; optic neuritis; papillitis; retrobulbar neuritis; conjunctivitis.</p>
<p>Urogenital System</p>
<p>Epididymitis; orchitis.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>Death from various, and in some cases unknown, causes has been reported rarely following vaccination with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines; however, a causal relationship has not been established in healthy individuals (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). No deaths or permanent sequelae were reported in a published post-marketing surveillance<br>
study in Finland involving 1.5 million children and adults who were vaccinated with M-M-R II during 1982 to 1993.{60}</p>
<p>Notice the use of words like rarely, generally, possibly, etc.  Not very specific, and naturally designed to downplay the problems.</p>
<p>Here is a list of complications from the Measles from the CDC website:</p>
<p>Common Complications</p>
<p>Common measles complications include ear infections and diarrhea.</p>
<p>    Ear infections occur in about one out of every 10 children with measles and can result in permanent hearing loss.<br>
    Diarrhea is reported in less than one out of 10 people with measles.</p>
<p>Severe Complications</p>
<p>Some people may suffer from severe complications, such as pneumonia (infection of the lungs) and encephalitis (swelling of the brain). They may need to be hospitalized and could die.</p>
<p>    As many as one out of every 20 children with measles gets pneumonia, the most common cause of death from measles in young children.<br>
    About one child out of every 1,000 who get measles will develop encephalitis (swelling of the brain) that can lead to convulsions and can leave the child deaf or mentally retarded.<br>
    For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die from it.</p>
<p>Measles may cause pregnant woman to give birth prematurely, or have a low-birth-weight baby.</p>
<p>There are risks on both ends.  However, both the pharmaceutical companies and the CDC have reason to downplay risks of the vaccine and exaggerate the complications of the disease, however subtly they do it.  People should be allowed to decide which set of risks is riskier for them in their circumstances.</p>

No thanks.<br>
I’m willing to concede that there may be instances where pharmaceutical drugs are necessary, but in my experience, they all come with side-effects and those are more likely to be serious if you have a vaccine-injured child. We have found other methods of maintaining health and treating infections when they do occur – which has been FAR LESS OFTEN since we stopped vaccinating.</p>

Of course, you may not believe this if you haven’t tried it, because you READ that that’s just quackery.  But, most of the people I know use natural treatments and I’ve seen this work many times.  My son has never taken a prescription or had a vaccination.  He only gets sick once or twice a year, usually a cold or upset stomach.  He got a rare cold a week or so ago after spending the day at a friend’s house who had a cold, along with his siblings.  I gave him Vit. C, Vit. D3, and raw organic honey (which has natural antibacterial properties and has been used for centuries as such).   He literally was sick for TWO days.  He had a little congestion after that, but nothing else.  I was stung by a bee this summer and after about a week, I showed it to my neighbor.  The entire surrounding area, bigger than a grapefruit, was red and swollen and itched and hurt.  She told me I better have a doctor look at it.  That night I put some of the same honey on it and covered it.  The next day I could barely see it.  I showed it to my neighbor and she was in shock.  She came over the next day and asked me what kind of honey I bought and where she could get it.  And, though my mother did give me some vaccinations when I was a kid, I haven’t had any since then.  I’ve never gotten a flu shot and haven’t had the flu in 25 years.  Vaccine proponents think we’re remiss in not giving vaccines because they prevent killer diseases with little to no risk.  1. We aren’t trying to prevent these illnesses.  Illnesses are a natural part of life and many experts believe they serve to build our immune system.  I’m not particularly religious, but I do believe that our creator doesn’t make mistakes.  If he gave us these illnesses, they probably serve some purpose whether or not our experts of today are aware of what that is or not. 2. As someone pointed out earlier, any disease can be considered a KILLER disease under the right circumstances.  Statistics I’ve seen say that only about 400 people per year died from measles before the vaccine came out, as compared to 12,000 from ulcers during the same time, for example.   This is HARDLY a killer-disease.  3.Perhaps the risk of permanent or serious injury from a vaccine IS rare, but so are complications from the disease itself.  But aside from the more obvious adverse reactions, the vaccine schedule, especially as it is now, undermines a person’s health in general and weakens the immune system.  So, less people get the measles now, but in exchange for that probably 1 out of every 3 children today either has autism, Asperger’s, ADHD, allergies, chronic ear infections etc.  This has become the norm now.  No one questions it.  I don’t attribute all of the sickness and disorders in our kids today to vaccines, because there are chemicals in our food, water, air and household and personal products that were never there before and our bodies are assaulted with them on a daily basis.  But, one difference is that the chemicals in vaccines are injected, bypassing the natural mechanisms in place for our bodies to separate and eliminate toxins.  None of this would be necessary if doctors were trained to teach people how to bolster and care for their immune systems instead of trying to eliminate viruses totally, and pushing drugs to treat illness.</p>

When I vaccinated my first child and she had a seizure in the night I began my own research in 1984 which was very limited.  I was shocked to find the MMR was derived from an aborted fetus.  My girlfriend wrote Merck and they were completely open and wrote her back about all the horrifying details.  I am a pro-lifer and feel this is disordered …..so of course I use my religious exemption.  Yes I am familiar with the USCCB statements but I am also familiar with the Popes statements not quite backing the USCCB, thus making it a very personal decision.  The questions I can’t seem to answer when people are so terribly mean to me about my decision to not vaccine are these:</p>
<p>1.  Why are the same people who claim a “Woman’s right to choose”  not kind to me about “my choice”?</p>
<p>2.  Why do people assume I’m uneducated and haven’t read or studied hard on this subject?</p>
<p>3.  Why did my Dr. know absolutely nothing about where the MMR shot was derived from?</p>
<p>4.  Why is their a rise in Autism? How can you disprove something isn’t linked when you can’t prove any link?</p>
<p>5.  Why is their a rise in Cancer?  Again millions of dollars of research and no answers.</p>
<p>6.  I had measles mumps and the chicken pox and so did all my friends and if these diseases are so dangerous how can it be I don’t know of anyone that was harmed?  I personally know at least 10 people harmed from vaccines?</p>
<p>7.   Why do people get so upset when I try to have the conversation if they really believe in their vaccines…aren’t they protected with no need to worry?  Please don’t say immune suppressed children because they are in more danger of recently vaccinated children carrying a live virus.</p>
<p>8.   Why do we not have an exact count or a link for the count to the recent outbreak at Disney, as to how many were vaccinated and how many were not?  I asked my doctor and he said because of HIPPA that even he didn’t know the counts.  So I asked then how does the news make statements with HIPPA? He didn’t know that answer.  Is it possible the breakout was vaccinated kids and adults that the shot didn’t offer protection any longer?   I would love to just have the simple truth ….not one guided by money or fear mongering.</p>
<p>I guess I am so puzzled as to why, as a concerned Mother I couldn’t speak to many people  of my very personal  decisions on vaccination because of the way I was bullied.  If  I straight out asked any of the above questions to people in a conversation, many would think it’s OK (and it seems politically correct to do so)  name calling, and accusations were the normal response I was given?</p>

And, why is it that they refuse to talk about or post the statistics of people who are harmed by vaccines or come down with the disease despite being vaccinated? What are they afraid of? Who are they afraid of? I am not anti-vax, but I am a concerned parent that is confused by what the truth is and fully understand that doctors, although highly educated and well-meaning, merely “practice” medicine. The use of the word “practice” is no accident and when you add big pharma and $billions it is kind of a perfect storm. What works and is safe for one is not so for all. When we were pregnant, we trained for natural child birth because we wanted to avoid unnecessary drugs and particularly a c-section birth which is nearly epidemic today and harmful to both mother and child. We also intended a hospital birth and as it turned out there were some complications during labor and my wife needed an epidural near the end of labor. That wasn’t our initial hope but we were informed and knew the options.  If we did not go through natural child birth training my wife would have had a c-section but again we were informed and knew the questions to ask. When my son was born, he received the standard Hepatitis B vaccination an hour after birth.. He had a severe reaction to the vaccine and two days later was in intensive care for 4 days fighting for his life. This was a horrible experience for us to say the least and it began our education on vaccinations. We understood why to vaccinate for measles, polio, pertussis, etc because they are such horrible diseases.  The moment we discovered that children are being vaccinated for chicken pox and how they vaccinate to protect while young we realized vaccinations are about more than just health.  The fact that there are so many vaccinations injected before an infant’s immune system even functions is also mind-boggling. Our son has not been vaccinated for anything else at this point but now that his immune system is fully functioning we will be on a schedule to slowly vaccinate him since he has family outside the U.S. that we want to take him to see. Thankfully, he is a very healthy 4 year old and thankfully has a very good pediatrician who although she would prefer us to vaccinate earlier is also very respectful and thoughtful of our concerns and our need to be informed. Jason the pediatrician is the kind of doctor that has no interest in his patients or their parents being fully informed of procedures or health needs beyond what he tells you. Trust me, don’t question me, I’m the doctor.  He would have been fired years ago!</p>

I’m sure that if you were in the actual presence of this person, and her vaccine-injured child, you would not make a comment like this.

If you look at the patters today, you see an increasing number of women  choosing to stay home, breastfeed, make healthy food choices and delay or omit vaccinations….why?

I believe that’s because they’ve been brainwashed to believe that vaccines are a miracle prevention tool just like everyone else, and that measles is a “killer disease,” and seeing a child get a disease from the very thing they believe prevents the disease just doesn’t fit into the realm of possibilities their minds can entertain.  The mind’s ability to deny evidence that is right in front of you, and not even second-hand reports, but actual physical proof, is amazing when it services our need to be right.   And, frankly, if I was a doctor who spent years injecting babies with vaccinations, and then saw evidence that it either doesn’t work or was harmful, I’m sure everything in me would want to explain it away.  The alternative is to admit, if only to yourself, that what you’ve been doing is not only not working, but may be causing harm to our most fragile and innocent population.  How will they live with themselves when they finally do get it?</p>

I also agree that vaccines do much more harm than good. This has been after months of going through countless articles on both sides. My daughter did get two rounds of Dtap and polio, buy will not be getting any more.<br>
Wit regards to all the comments from pro-vaxers, I wouldn’t bother to give them the time of day, if I were you. They have just as much right to do the research and publish articles stating their side as you do. Rather that than post rude comments on another’s post. Don’t stoop to their level…God bless!</p>

They are too weak. These people are part of the mix of what the diseases gene pool has to deal with and so when the weaker people only half develop a response from the vaccine the disease is not killed entirely, but it has experience with the vaccine and may get a handle on how to beat it. This plays heavily into what the disease will develop into and into what it becomes in the future. Therefore, we need to ask are we building a stronger disease gene pool that is lying dormant as a or like a retrovirus in somebodies adipose tissues or bones. Are we training the disease to fight our vaccination system by not applying the vaccines correctly. Is supplying the vaccine to the most vulnerable actually the worst strategy that we could possibly do, because they are the least effective in making the vaccine work. </p>
<p>So if we are going to do this job right we need a non crap diet and pollution free food etc so the vaccines can be aided by an immune system that can do their job fully and completely. We must remember that our immune systems are the delivery systems for the vaccine. The vaccine is not a potent measles killer until our immune system kicks into gear. So, what our immune system is doing is critical to defeating the measles. A weakened immune system leaves parts of the virus alive. Not leaving dribs and drabs of half beaten virus behind to jump out later is as much of a goal in my opinion as is saving lives in the present.</p>

Your point about the additives is a good one. There are also internal documents and meeting notes from scientists at the CDC and “industry experts” from pharmaceutical companies in which the concerns about the high number of unknown and unidentifiable viruses in vaccines is discussed. Instead of letting the public know, they covered it up and stayed silent.<br>

<p>I don’t think our immune systems were ever intended to process some of the horrific things contained in vaccines.  One thing you all need to remember is that present medical convention goes way beyond just the MMR vac.  Our poor, defenseless and voiceless children are force-fed dozens of injections containing all manner of toxic ingredients and the health care industry pedals this garbage as absolutely necessary (dear god, how did we ever make it into the 1900s?) while shrugging off the staggering rise of neurological disorders, cancer, and birth defects as coincidental and unrelated.  When someone has a financial interest (hospitals and pharmacies aren’t giving these vac’s out for free, y’know) then their opinion about vaccines falls under a thing called “conflict of interest”.  Then there’s the government who has many reps from pharma and other ne’er-do-well organizations embedded deep in the legislative branch and these fools still categorize marijuana as a “class 1 narcotic” yet pro-vaccine types cite these folks when trying to present case FOR mandatory vaccinations.  Its the blind leading the blind and people are too happy to follow.  Crazy, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Then you’ve got the woman several posts above shouting that if it keeps her one child from being killed by measles, then she is all for mandatory worldwide vaccination.  Well, ma’am by that rationale you might just take away everyone’s right to convey themselves by automobile (a privilege you yourself probably wouldn’t surrender) due to the ABSOLUTE FACT that your child is more likely to die thusly than from measles.</p>

My 8 year old daughter received no vaccinations until the age of 5. At that age, I slowly started introducing vaccines into her system. This past July 2014 she received 2 vaccines that her doctor deemed ‘benign’ and safe to give together. For 2 weeks her immune system had obvious compromise – she had diarrhea, upset stomach, wasn’t eating well, looked pale, and all of her fingertips were bright pink and blistered. Following that, about 2 weeks later, she was stung by a bee on her foot, blew up like a balloon in the space of a few minutes, and had to be rushed to the emergency room. Can you really tell me that the two incidents were unrelated? Her doctor was told of her response to the vaccines, and just politely listened and did nothing, and I’m and guessing did not report it to the proper health bureaucracies. It is clear to me as her parent that her immune system was compromised following her latest vaccination, and that is why her reaction to the bee sting was so drastic and sudden. Can I prove it? No. BUT, I can make wise decisions for her future based on my knowledge of my child, and choose when and if I continue to give her vaccinations. The plethora of anecdotal stories about children’s responses to vaccines, (not just the measles vaccine) is the reason why not everyone gives the measles or any other vaccines to their kids. The government is full of self-interest and the vaccine companies have monetary goals at stake in their pursuit of 100% vaccination for all kids.</p>

Vaccinating them so they never get any kind of infection is counter-productive. They need to get sick sometimes in order to be healthier in the long run.<br>
You have bought into the fear.<br>
I hope you will take some time to listen to the interview in this post, and really learn about what’s being injected into your children.<br>

The outbreak that happened in US 1964/65 was the call to action to find a vaccine – over 12 million people contracted measles over those two years – you can find scanned medical journals from back then on Google, the total deaths of neonates is reported at over 2100 (those are exclusively babies and children) another 10,000 pregnant mothers contracted measles and had either a still birth or had to have a therapeutic abortion… of the children born to mothers with measles 11,000 of those were deaf and another 3,600 blind and many other experienced development delays, my language, in the medical journals they refer to them as retarded, it was 1965 after all.  I know these are all acceptable percentages to the author, the 2000 deaths over those two years is probably lower than the historical death rate, but as a nation it was unacceptable…the introduction of widespread vaccination has resulted in a situation where anything over 15 cases a year becomes newsworthy.</p>

Alterations in DNA at an early age is the basis of childhood cancers. Prior to the time when we “wiped out” measles in this country, we didn’t have the epidemics of childhood cancers we now have. We also didn’t have all of the autoimmune diseases, life-threatening allergies, or neuro-developmental disorders we have now. We have traded what for most were short-lived childhood infections, which for the vast majority resolved on their own without lasting problems, for epidemics of serious, chronic, life-threatening and life-ending illness.<br>
Children born in the United States are the most highly vaccinated children in the world, and they are also among the sickest, with 54% of U.S. children diagnosed with at least one chronic health condition. The U.S. also has the highest infant mortality rate among developed nations.<br>
Clearly the massive vaccination assault on our kids is not working for them.</p>

Many people against vaccination are listing their *own* experiences, saying they had measles, mumps &amp; rubella and didn’t die, etc. or that the amount of people who did die of measles was such a low number. If people who are not vaccinating their children are insisting on facts so much to prove that vaccination is “worse” than not, where are those FACTS people? And you love your children SO much, like everyone else…what if your child was seriously immune compromised due to a serious illness, and yes there are a lot of them?! You’re saying you really wouldn’t mind a growing number of children, adolescents and now adults walking around the nation, in airports, other countries …breathing on and touching your sick child? Your child or children are going to grow up. They may want to join the Peace Corp (a statistically likely fact <img src="./Putting Measles Into Perspective _ VaxTruth.org_files/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley"> they may work for National Geographic. The country may take a major major turn for the worse and your currently nicely taken care of child may end up on some very hard times and will be a vulnerable prey to a serious illness. We often don’t learn from history and I think this is one of those cases, although not a perfect analogy, but if you were to ask thousands of people over the age of 70 what they think of people not vaccinating their children I wonder what their opinion would be? Yes, opinion, these are all opinions, many based on fact (doctors) and many based on experience yes. One’s experience of “living through” measles episodes over the years along with everyone else is not the same as other people’s. But I’ve listed my opinion here and my opinions (for what they’re worth) are based on factual medical statistical data. I used to be against vaccinations. I do think people make decisions based on their PRECONCEIVED notions of an idea, like don’t trust doctors or don’t trust the government, then they go out and look for facts based on those opinions. There just are not enough of those facts and don’t be stubborn about it as this is a life or death situation for immune compromised children. My oldest was not vaccinated and he ended up with Autism (born in 2001)…I notice no one is talking about the “facts” of vaccinations causing Autism anymore? Hmmm….opinions change. Facts don’t. Please change your opinions based on fact (not skewed statistics either)…..</p>

Doctors are telling you what they have been taught to believe without question. Doctors are not educated in medical school about vaccinations, other than how to give them according to the schedule. They aren’t taught about vaccine ingredients and they aren’t told that vaccines are not studied for synergistic effects as they are given in the real world scenario.<br>
Second, I don’t know where you’re getting your information from, but we are most definitely still talking about the fact that vaccines cause autism.<br>
Third, my daughter is one of those who refer to, with an immune system deficiency syndrome. Vaccines destroyed her health. She can never receive another vaccine. I would never ask another parent to go through what our family has endured for the sake of protecting my daughter. That’s my job.<br>
And for the record, there are a ton of things children like mine are vulnerable to, including the common cold. Protecting her from everything that might harm her would require keeping her in a bubble, which I will not do (and wouldn’t do even if I could).<br>
She has a right to quality of life and to make decisions for herself. I will continue to support her as much as possible, and will give her the tools she needs to protect herself and her health to the best of our mutual ability.<br>
If you want to know more about autism and vaccines and skewed statistics, check out the CDC Whistleblower issue – hint… it’s not just black boys and it’s not just the MMR vaccine.</p>

Measles was essentially eliminated from this country thanks to the measles vaccine. It was only after people stopped vaccinating their children that it has been popping up here and there since around 2000-2002.   As for those here who believe measles is a benign infection, it is not for a significant percentage of those who contract it.  From the Quebec health services website: <a href="http://www.msss.gouv.qc.ca/en/sujets/prob_sante/measles/measles.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.msss.gouv.qc.ca/en/sujets/prob_sante/measles/measles.php</a> </p>
<p>“…In 1989, during the last Québec measles epidemic, over 10,000 cases were reported. Those affected were mainly school-age children. Out of the 656 who were hospitalized, 10 developed encephalitis and 7 died.</p>
<p>The introduction of a vaccination program in the mid-1970s made it possible to prevent and reduce the occurrence of the disease. Although outbreaks have continued to take place in Québec, they have steadily decreased in intensity….”</p>
<p>Here’s a good article recapping the history of measles and what has been done to eradicated it. Prior vaccinations, measles required some 48,000 hospitalizations a year and caused 400 to 500 deaths. It isn’t clear how many complications resulted from the 48,000 hospitalizations but they included hearing loss from ear infections. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-na-measles-timeline-20150205-story.html#page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-na-measles-timeline-20150205-story.html#page=1</a></p>
<p>People here like to share their anecdotal stories. I’m 53 and have a twin brother. Two winters ago my twin and my 80 year old mother contracted whooping cough. I had received a whooping cough booster the year before and did not catch it even though I spent quite a bit of time around my mother and brother. They call it the 100-day cough and that’s exactly what it was to the day. That was 100 days of misery for my brother and especially my mother who became very sick. If you’ve never heard someone with whooping cough, you’re fortunate. It is painful even to listen to. </p>
<p>Here is the story behind whooping cough of pertussis: In the pre-vaccination era (during the 1920s and ’30s), there were over 250,000 cases of whooping cough per year in the U.S., with up to 9,000 deaths. In the 1940s, the pertussis vaccine, combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (DTP), was introduced. By 1976, the incidence of whooping cough in the U.S. had decreased by over 99%.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, however, the incidence of whooping cough began to increase and has risen steadily, with epidemics typically occurring every three to five years in the U.S. In the epidemic of 2005, 25,616 cases were reported according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2008, over 13,000 cases of whooping cough were reported in the U.S., resulting in 18 deaths. In 2010, which included an epidemic in California (see below), 27,550 cases of pertussis were reported nationwide.</p>
<p>In 2012, over 48,000 cases of pertussis infection were reported in the U.S., the highest number of reported cases in one year since 1955.</p>

Since 2005 there have been 108 deaths reported to VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System) from the MMR vaccine. There have been 57 cases filed for death from MMR vaccine with the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.<br>
With regard to whooping cough, as you state that you had received a booster, it is quite possible that your mother and brother may have contracted parapertussis from you.

Unfortunately, it’s difficult to determine. The Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) is the only database we have. There are 329 deaths reported to VAERS from the MMR vaccine. That number reflects reports of deaths from October 1989 through December 14, 2014. Unfortunately, the majority of people have never heard of VAERS and even though doctors are legally mandated by the 1986 Law that established the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) to report vaccine injuries and deaths, the vast majority of them don’t report. The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published a report indicating that less than 10% of any adverse reactions to any pharmaceutical product or medical device is ever reported, and when it comes to vaccines, the estimates drop to 1-2%.<br>
What we know is that since 2000, there have been 154 deaths reported to VAERS from MMR and other measles vaccines (MMRV, MR, MEA), with 114 deaths in children under the age of 3 years. We know that’s a gross underestimate.<br>
Since 2000, there have been 1,985 cases of measles reported in the United States, with 4 measles-associated deaths. There was 1 death in 2005 in a 75 year-old man who died from secondary pneumonia due to underlying health conditions. There was 1 “measles-associated” death in 2003 in a 13 year-old girl who had cancer and received a bone marrow transplant in October 2002 and died in January 2003. There was no history of measles in the girl, but on autopsy they found measles in her brain. That STRONGLY suggests it was the vaccine-strain measles and she had an atypical reaction to vaccination. The other two reported measles-related deaths are from 2000 and 2001, and I was not able to find specifics in those cases.<br>
Here is a journal article documenting vaccine-strain measles in the brain of a 21 month-old child who died of encephalitis. He, like the 13 year-old mentioned above, had no history of clinical measles illness:  <a href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/4/855" rel="nofollow">http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/4/855</a></p>

Washington state on 2/11/14 introduced a bill to the state’s House to eliminate philosophical exemptions.  Our Governor Inslee seems to support the measure.  The panic and fear prevalent right now following the Disneyland outbreak and Ebola fears makes it seem more likely than not that we will lose this exemption option, and it seems also unlikely that a religious or medical exemption would be granted, unless an extreme case can be documented, e.g. Proof that we’re Amish or follow the Church of Scientology, or a have documented seizure.  Is homeschooling or moving to another state the only option?  I haven’t found any information on what the reality is of a state eliminating exemptions.  I recall seeing an article of an adolescent girl pinned to the floor I think in Mississippi getting a forced vaccination/assault, but is this just more fear mongering?  I’d like to hear from those who have experiences.  It seems to me that forcing people to leave school as “public health policy” removes a primary communication channel to everyone when outbreaks do occur, if people want to avoid them.  I’m also left wondering how/where children who are assaulted in this manner will unconsciously redirect their anger later and how that serves public safety?</p>

I personally find it very interesting that the Disneyland Measles Outbreak and hype are ratcheted to a fever-pitch (pun intended), with less than 150 cases. There were nearly 700 measles cases reported in 2014, with near complete silence in the media. The timing and hysteria now are quite suspect. Multiple bills have been introduced in multiple states, simultaneously… were they already drafted and ready to go?<br>
What factor does the CDC Whistleblower issue play in this? Quite interesting that Dr. William Thompson was granted official whistleblower status and immunity from prosecution, and this was announced in January, at the height of the measles furor.</p>

He was diagnosed in childhood with PIDD, primary immune deficiency disorder. People with PIDD should never receive live virus vaccines, and he suffered greatly after the administration of several live virus vaccines. When he had his 18 month MMR, he had had a long history of repeated chronic infections, and had a cold at the time he received the vaccine. The doctor was unconcerned by his history of repeated infections or his cold. Of the many problems I have with vaccines, this is the main one: doctors do not know who is going to respond poorly to a vaccine, and may vaccinate some children like my son who go on to have immune deficiencies.  Until there is a way to accurately tell who is going to have complications, adverse reactions, or is contraindicated from receiving them, it is foolish to give the shots willy-nilly, and in my opinion VERY UNSCIENTIFIC. Encephalitis is supposedly a rare complication of MMR- although I dispute that based on how many cases I have heard of- but when its YOUR CHILD who gets a brain injury, you don’t  care how “rare” the side effect is. My pediatrician did not perform due diligence  when it came to evaluating the risks to my son of MMR, and I suspect that in their rush to vaccinate all children, many pediatricians ignore warning signs like chronic infections and vaccinate children who should not be vaccinated.</p>

You just told our family’s story, too.<br>
It is not a coincidence that we don’t know which groups of children are more susceptible to vaccine-injury.<br>
In 2004 the Institute of Medicine made a calculated decision to NOT perform ANY research that would identify susceptible groups.<br>
I don’t think it’s a coincidence that decision came within a very short time after Frank DeStefano presented the information about the finding that African-American boys were at greatly increased risk of autism from the MMR vaccine – information that was subsequently left out of the later-published paper. This is the central issue of the CDC Whislelblower issue, and is no doubt why we are now experiencing so much media hype about measles.<br>

I do not vaccinate because of the increasing amount of vac. and not being able to choose which ones. I do not understand the hep b given to infants. Hep b and of course c I would say the % using drugs or having unprotected sex is extremely low. They might be exposed to blood or body fluids but even that has to be very low .000001 or something. Having been and EMT for 18 years and not having the Hep shot (many reasons one Hep b and c is all it protects you from and the risks come from the mutated forms very few cases of just Hep b) even the risk to me was very low and even though I was exposed often. What I continually see is no regard for probable over possible? I to had measles, mumps and chicken pox. Back to my questions what is the risk of a infant contracting Hep.?<br>
What is the research on the chicken pox vac.? I have read that before the chicken pox vac .children’s shingles was unheard of now it is becoming common. I would like input on this as the information I have read is disturbing. Plus the 7 in 1000 that have a serious  reaction to  the shot seems to be the same as have life threatening problems from chicken pox information from the health department printout only the wording serious to life threatening was changed.  I agree can’t find complete information so it is hard to really know what is right. To the people who are making rude wishes of death and blindness you are part of the problem. How come I can’t ask these questions, why aren’t you? How come I can’t choose which vac. and when they are given?<br>
As to side effects they are not reported often in my experience. I know of 4 cases of seizures in children 1 to 2 days after being vac. and nothing was documented as the vac. being the possible cause neither were the parents informed or the possibility of vac. causing more complications. In fact one mother’s insistence that the seizure was a reaction to that vac earlier that day was told it was highly unlikely. She was told that it was impossible to determine what had caused the seizure.<br>
This was a 4 month old, I do not know if this child had anymore problems. I pray not. My neighbor’s son began rocking and was later diagnosed with autism that evening after vac. This was not reported because it has been determined that vac. do not cause autism. Healthy 3 year old to one who rocks and often screams from the day after being given 12 vac. that day. The parents were blamed at first by the doctor for allowing these behavior and they were told he would grow out of them. He has not.<br>
Sorry mostly L just want more information on other vac. besides the mmr.  and information on research being done. Thank you</p>

I went through all the ‘childhood diseases’, measles, German measles, chicken pox, mumps, etc.  When my son was young, he had the MMR series at his pediatricians insistence.  Shortly, he developed seizure disorder (Epilepsy).  After researching MMR vaccination, I’m sure that his seizures were due to brain swelling that is often associated with MMR vaccination.  A few years later, those seizures killed my son.  I would never advocate many vaccines, especially for diseases that had such a small rate of permanent disabilities or death.  I will say, despite the controversy,  I am pleased the horrible spectre of horribly crippling polio is finally over.  I had a number of friends stricken and crippled for what was generally a short life.  My point is that the good must be weighed against the bad.  In the case of MMR, it seems that the bad outweighs the good.</p>

The point is that the death rate had dropped in the U.S. by more than 98% and in the U.K., the death rate had declined by nearly 100% before the vaccine was introduced. Since there are documented benefits (developmental gains, positive effects on the immune system) from getting measles and recovering from it, the question for me is, Why do we feel it is necessary to completely eradicate measles?<br>
The measles vaccine that was introduced in 1963 was pulled from the market because it was causing too many reactions. The MMR vaccine was developed a few years later and was introduced widely for school children in 1971.<br>
The article does not advocate treating measles with water. It advocates giving Cod Liver Oil, which has been used by knowledgeable physicians for nearly 100 years, and is documented in the medical literature since 1932.<br>
There is no way to know what the true death rate or rate of serious adverse reactions is from the MMR vaccine. The Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database contains 329 reports of death from measles vaccine since 1989. The 1986 Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Program MANDATES physicians and healthcare workers to report ALL vaccine reactions; however, the law is not being enforced and there are no consequences for those who fail (or refuse) to report reactions. As a result, it is estimated that 1-2% of serious vaccine reactions is included in that database (per article in JAMA, author is Kessler).<br>
The statement that vaccine reactions are “rare” and occur at a 1 in a million rate is just make believe.</p>

<p>I have in the past devoted too much time and emotional energy making the case for the measles vaccine with those who have joined the anti-vaccine movement, and I always came away feeling demoralized and defeated. I reflected on these dark emotions and realized I had to take a different, healthier approach to this controversy. I’ve done some reading on my own, and I’m convinced that measles could be eradicated by a comprehensive world-wide effort. It’s certainly far from a sure thing, but it does seem possible and worth the attempt.</p>
<p>I then went to the American Red Cross website and donated $100.00 to the Measles &amp; Rubella Initiative, which works around to world to fund efforts to end Measles and Rubella for good. In the future, if I’m feeling a strong emotional response to anyone who is trying to convince parents to avoid the measles vaccine, rather than trying to reason with them I’m going to donate again, and if feel the need to post a comment on a website I will leave a comment suggesting others donate to this vaccination initiative as well. If I just need to brighten my day, I’ll make a donation. This approach to overcoming their objections to the vaccine seems more likely to succeed, and is far more satisfying. If measles can be eradicated, everyone wins. No more virus. No more vaccines. No more adverse effects. No more endless arguments.</p>
<p>My spirits lifted the moment I experienced this epiphany! To borrow a bit from MLK, I have a dream that someday NO parent will have to choose between the risks of vaccinating their child and the risks of contracting a potentially deadly virus, and when that day comes everyone who contributed to the effort can join together in celebrating the victory! A victory that will benefit all of humanity, even those who tried stand in our way!</p>
<p>Here’s a description of the program:</p>
<p>Launched in 2001, the Measles Initiative–led by the American Red Cross, the United Nations Foundation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF and the World Health Organization–provides technical and financial support to governments and communities for mass vaccination campaigns and disease surveillance around the world. The Measles Initiative–known since April 2012 as the Measles &amp; Rubella Initiative–has supported the vaccination of more than 1 billion children helping to reduce measles deaths by 74% globally (compared to 2000). To learn more, visit <a href="http://www.measlesinitiative.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.measlesinitiative.org</a><br>
You can also text PREVENT to 90999 to give $10 to the American Red Cross. Charges will appear on your wireless bill, or be deducted from your prepaid balance. All purchases must be authorized by account holder. Must be 18 years of age or have parental permission to participate. Message and Data Rates May Apply. Text STOP to 90999 to STOP.

As a mother of an immune compromised child who receives IVIG for PIDD weekly, my son is one of the people often used in these debates- he is in a high risk group, immune compromised people. When we go out in public we often run into sick people who are out, people who don’t wash their hands in restrooms, and people who don’t cover their mouths when they cough. If all the energy that went into debating vaccines went into teaching and encouraging people to practice basic hygiene- DO NOT go out when you are sick, stay home and rest, wash your hands thoroughly before eating, after using the bathroom, etc,. cover your mouth/sneeze into your arm, this would make me so happy!!! People act like vaccinating is the only thing you can do to prevent the spread of disease, when taking common sense measures, especially staying home when ill, would go such a long way toward preventing the spread of disease. People in this culture seem to think its some kind of badge of honor to go out when you’re sick and then complain about being sick- every time you go out when you are ill you are exposing immune compromised people, elderly people, and infants to your germs, and for these people getting a cold or flu is not a minor inconvenience. So when people talk about immunizing there should be just as much emphasis on preventing the spread of illness, not treating it like a badge of honor.</p>

I am anti-vaccination for myself and my children, but I would not stop you. It is the inflammatory statements from people like Jason that confuse the issues. I believe the risk to people who choose vaccination to be their rights just as the risk to me and my children to be my risks. The statements that unvaccinated child and adults pose a risk to others doesn’t make sense. If you or your child has a disease that would leave the immune system down your chances of it getting measles from an unvaccinated child is so low first the child has to have the measles. A record number of  cases in 2014 was 644 out of a population of 318 million in the United States do the math. The fear I understand is that if the number of unvaccinated continues to rise so will the risk to the vaccinated is a strange conclusion.  Just because you have not been vaccinated does not mean you have the measles does the doctor check everyone included himself to make sure he is immune to the measles before coming in contact with cancer patients. I was vaccinated in school but had the measles and mumps anyway. The mmr  does not prove you have lifetime immunity as you know. We need doctors to lead the way to rational beliefs. Yes if a person has a fever or rash you should not be out exposing everyone to whatever you might have. I again was an Emt for 18 years I know that both nurses and doctors see patients while knowingly sick. I  believe that fear is the what is driving so much of unproductive fighting energy both sides need to stop attacking and let the facts come out. I nor my children have the measles and the chances of you getting them from me is impossible. Both my older children had the measles you can’t catch the measles from them my younger child did not get the measles in spite living in the house. She was 1 years old. My husband doesn’t remember having the measles nor was he vaccinated and he did not get the measles more of these examples  don’t help because it also comes down to fear and possible and what if and other examples from the other side. Just know most of us want just to be able to take are own risks and you take yours. Look realistically a the numbers and quit threaten us with forces vaccinations.</p>

Sometimes things happen and sometimes people die.<br>
Having said that, there have been documented cases of horizontal transmission of vaccine-strain viruses, including measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and influenza. My daughter caught H1N1 from a classmate who had received the FluMist vaccine and came to school during the time he was “shedding” the live attenuated virus. In that case, my daughter did not die (thankfully), and she recovered fully after a few days in bed and attention to diet and supplements to strengthen her immune system.<br>
Had she died, who would be to blame?<br>
I suppose the case could be made that it was the family of the child who had been vaccinated, or the school that held the vaccine clinic, or the nurse who gave the FluMist and did not caution the parents about the danger their child posed to other children – like mine.</p>

The last measles-related death in the U.S. was in 2005, in a 75 year-old man who died from secondary pneumonia due to underlying health problems. In 2003, a 13 year-old girl was deemed a “measles-related death.” She was a cancer patient who underwent a bone marrow transplant in October 2002 and died in January 2003. On autopsy, measles was found in her brain. She had never had a documented measles infection and it is assumed the person who donated the bone marrow was not infected with measles (he/she would have been screened), so it is likely the measles in her brain came from the vaccines she received as a child. There have been other documented cases of measles in the brains of autistic children who died from drowning and underwent autopsy after their deaths.<br>
As for deaths from MMR vaccination, the only database we have is the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), which is maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). VAERS is a passive reporting system, and even though the 1986 Vaccine Injury Compensation Law mandates that doctors and healthcare providers report adverse events, there are no consequences for failure to report and the AMA estimates only 1-2% of even the most serious adverse reactions to vaccines are ever reported. There are 329 deaths from MMR vaccine which have been reported since October 1989. That’s likely a gross underestimate of the problem.</p>

<p>Mobility and ease of travel is one significant difference. You say that we’re doing much better than the rest of the world, but those folks can simply hop on a plane and be here (spreading whatever diseases they might be carrying, even if they aren’t showing symptoms) in a matter of hours.  That really wasn’t a significant factor in the 1960s. We just saw this with a few cases of Ebola in the US, didn’t we?</p>
<p>By limiting the discussion to measles deaths, you (conveniently) ignore the side effects of the disease. In 1986, UK physicians estimated that 100,000 cases of measles occurred in the UK each year.  While it’s true that only 10 or so cases resulted in deaths, TEN THOUSAND cases led to ear and/or chest infections. Those numbers do not include cases that lead to other lifelong complications, such as deafness or partial sight.</p>
<p>So, does it change our thinking if we stop saying “10 deaths” and start saying “10 deaths, 10,000 ear/chest infections, plus some number of cases of permanent deafness/blindness”?  I think so.</p>

I can tell you that vaccines caused my daughter and many other children to have chronic ear infections, upper respiratory infections, stomatitis, conjunctivitis, and many, many other infections. Prior to the addition of the hepatitis B and HiB vaccines in 1989-1990, recurrent ear infections in infants were rare. Now they are so common that young parents think it’s normal for infants and children to have 3-4 ear infections each year, with each being treated with antibiotics. American children are the most highly vaccinated children (more vaccines given at an earlier age) in the world. The U.S. has the worst infant mortality rate among developed nations. We give twice the number of vaccines in the first year of life as countries like Sweden and Denmark, and our infant mortality rate is nearly three times theirs.<br>
54% of American children are diagnosed with at least one chronic illness including autoimmune diseases, neurological and gastrointestinal diseases.<br>
Clearly, the current system is not working for our children.</p>

For the record, the 1 in 88 number was announced in 2012 and did not include any children under the age of 12. In 2014, the 1 in 68 number was announced, and again, did not include any children under the age of 12. Extrapolating the data (as I did in 2012), the true numbers are currently at least 1 in 21 among three year-olds. See the following posts for more information:<br>

And consumers are never given enough information about the risks vs benefits in order to make an educated decisions. This is a very thoughtful analysis because it does uncover the risk of not being vaccinated for measles. Most of our doctors do not understand the risk/benefit. They certainly do not encourage thoughtful consideration. It is also easy to be suspicious of the pharmaceutical industry. Drugs do have side effects and the idea that children should have 63 different vaccines up to the age of 18 is mind numbing to me. So I do not blame parents for considering vaccines. I consider them brave for even thinking of going up against the medical establishment with the purpose of protecting their children. </p>
<p>AS of this date, news about the measles has faded slightly. It will be interesting to see how the “epidemic” progresses. It would seem to me that those who are vaccinated should feel protected. Unvaccinated children should only be a risk to those others who are not vaccinated. That is the theory. We will soon know, how bad it is or isn’t. </p>
<p>On a side note. Who knew, eggs are good again! It’s not what we don’t know that bothers me. It’s what we think we know that ain’t so.</p>

It’s worthwhile to note that the US has a Vaccine Injury Compensation Program for people who suffer illness from  vaccines. It has paid out almost $4 Billion to date, including more than $1 Billion in the past 4 years and almost $100 Million in 2015 so far. The hysteria being created by pro-vaccines groups is outrageous.

There are strong forces attempting to eliminate the personal exemptions.  Medical exemptions would remain but you would be at the mercy of doctors, who based on my experience have never read the in depth research and data.  The health department currently is considering revising its orders requiring an updated exemption signed by a parent each year.  The rationale is that parents currently have it too easy to sign the exemptions once.  They supposedly want to balance it out, forcing parents to have the issue in front of them each year.  I spoke with a reporter on this issue and reminded her that each year my son goes to his pediatrician and the issue of vaccinations always is spoken about.  I have spent enormous time researching and updating my research on my options.  Compare this with those parents who simply comply with the standard recommended vaccination schedule without any research at all.</p>

And that ONE child you dismiss as a number behind a decimal and a bunch of zeros doesn’t need to die at all. Humans have gotten smarter than the measles disease and figured out how to stop even ONE child from suffering and maybe dying from it. Maybe the “scare tactics” the CDC uses aren’t tactics at all, just an immense appreciation of the value of even ONE life!</p>

What was the value of HIS life?  Who do I balme?  Just  who?  He didn’t die of any MMR, but the very thing that was supposed to prevent him from dying from a relative non-toxic disease that was on it’s way out of civilization before that vaccine to prevent it.

I would pick measles over autism, autoimmune disorders, diabetes, or any other of the long list of potential side effects listed on the insert of the mmr vaccine  (minus the autism, seeing as they will never admit that one). I love my children more than anything in the world, you’d better believe I have made this descion based on research that is unbiased and only have their best interests in mind. I have no problem with the idea of protecting against deadly diseases, but I do not trust the manufacturers nor the ingredients. Perhaps if they hope to achieve a 100% vaccination rate, they need to build a better vaccine, be held responsible and liable and attempt to gain my trust. Until then, I’ll continue to not vaccinate and they’ll continue their fear mongoring for profit schemes. Thank you again!</p>

Those who had these ailments in childhood, along with all their friends, family and classmates, didn’t find it to be particularly onerous. They presume that those children who do die from these ailments must have weakened immune systems or suffer from malnutrition.<br>
Could it be the same children with weakened immune systems who suffer from vaccine complications? If so, it could explain why measles death rates are higher today. Those of us who receive the vaccine without complication are also the same group who would have recovered from the disease without complication.</p>
