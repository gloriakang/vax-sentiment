6,measles infection,typically accompanied by a severe,immunosuppression,
7,immunosuppression,"often thought to be transient, which increases the host's",susceptibility to other illnesses,

9,measles vaccine,appears to prevent some,opportunistic infections,
10,measles vaccine,protective effects can lead to reduction in,infectious disease mortality,of roughtly five years--and even persist for life in some cases

16,mass vaccination,"in Europe and the U.S., against measles was followed by reduction in",reduction in childhood mortality,
17,reduction in childhood mortality,was due to,nonmeasles infectious diseases,
