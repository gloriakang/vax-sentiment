Lanny Edwards. </p><p>Otherwise, he said, he could only repeat what was quickly known after the 6:50 a.m. call to police Tuesday: Scott Bertics, a Lafayette resident on leave from his studies at Stanford University, apparently killed himself after shooting Clare Orton, who was home on vacation after her freshman year at San Diego State University. Both were studying engineering.</p><p>Nothing that police have found hinted at the tragedy that occurred, Edwards said. "There was no indication, no history, no previous concern," Edwards said. </p><p>The two had dated but not recently, he said. </p><p>Both were high school athletes, long-distance runners with an interest in engineering. Bertics graduated from Acalanes High School in 2012 and Orton from Las Lomas in 2014.</p><p>"They were just two good kids from churchgoing families who knew each other," Edwards said. </p><p>Orton\'s death drew some mournful comments on Twitter.</p><p>"My heart goes out to my lifelong schoolmate and former soccer teammate.

Tina Huang, who worked for Twitter as a software engineer between 2009 and 2014, alleged in a lawsuit that the company\'s promotion process favored men. Ex-Facebook employee Chia Hong also filed a lawsuit alleging that she was discriminated against and harassed because of her gender and Taiwanese descent. Both companies have denied the allegations made in the lawsuits.</p><p>At the very least, advocacy groups say that Twitter\'s blunder should have tech firms thinking twice about their workplace culture and the importance of diversity.</p><p>"The solution is to think about what kind of culture you want to create," Kosaraju said. "Do you want to create an environment where everyone\'s voice is heard and you\'re creating the best products and solutions for your customers or do you want it to be a frat party?" </p><p class="taglinejb">Contact Queenie Wong at 408-920-2706.

The project, spearheaded by psychology professor Dr. Philip Zimbardo (played with confidence, even arrogance by Billy Crudup), revealed the darkest corridors of human nature. The film teems with fierce performances from an up-to-the task cast made up of mostly young faces, though at just over two hours, it\'s longer than it needs to be. No matter: From start to finish, Alvarez and screenwriter Tim Talbott have the audience in lockdown mode in this claustrophobic nail-biter. </p><div style="width:336px" class="articleEmbeddedAdBox"><hr class="articleAdRule"/><div class="articleAdHeader">Advertisement</div><!-- Begin DFP Premium ad uniqueId: dfp-EMBEDDED --><hr class="articleAdRule"/></div><p>Its visceral punch is delivered in part by photography director Jas Shelton, who casts the proceedings in a cancerlike pallor that evokes an unsettling mood. Era-appropriate wide-tie clothing and set design also make the film feel and look like the real deal.</p><p>Those scene-setters, coupled with a screenplay that includes some verbatim dialogue from taped events, lend the film its documentarylike texture as Alvarez takes us through the 1971 study Zimbardo and his small team embarked on when they hired 24 male students out of 75 applicants, paying them $15 a day to participate. Once selected, the group was divided into "inmates" and "guards" and put into "Stanford County Prison," a fake penitentiary staged in the basement of Jordan Hall, home of the school\'s psychology department. The setup included transforming a closet into "The Hole," where the unruly were subjected to darkened solitary confinement.</p><p>The study in prison dynamics was slated to last two weeks, but Zimbardo halted it after just six days as the guards grew more forceful and antagonistic and inmates began to emotionally crumble. </p><p>The cruelty emerged from day one, with the guards, especially one dubbed John Wayne (Michael Angarano, in a chilling performance that should land him an Oscar nomination), trying to one-up each other in how they psychologically abuse their fellow students. Even before the prisoners are sent to prison, an alarm bell suggests the whole scenario might get out of control as overeager cops "arrest" Daniel Culp/8612 (Ezra Miller). Initially, he doesn\'t take things seriously, but the moment he enters prison, he realizes something is amiss. Stripped and told to wear "dresslike" garb, the prisoners see the guards begin to provoke. </p><p>As the experiment progresses, prisoners are subjected to numerous humiliations. Some are tossed in the "Hole," and later they\'re lined up and told to hump each other like camels. In one of the most jarring sequences, guards put paper bags on the prisoners\' heads, creating an eerie scene that evokes the horrific images from Abu Ghraib.</p><p>All of this transpires in less than a week, with the film reflecting how quickly even the researchers became willing participants, at times encouraging what was happening, and failing to bring a halt to what they were seeing. That included Zimbardo (a consultant on the film, which was based on his subsequent book, "The Lucifer Effect"), who assigned himself the role of prison superintendent. When the professor\'s girlfriend, Christina Maslach (Olivia Thirlby), a recent Stanford Ph.D. headed for a teaching job at UC Berkeley, joins the "prison" board late in the game, she\'s alarmed by how far the experiment has gone. </p><p>Neither Crudup nor the film itself soft-pedals Zimbardo\'s reaction to the out-of-control experiment, especially his insistence in wanting to continue. Crudup gives a confident portrayal that never goes overboard. Nelsan Ellis adds simmering resentment to his role playing Jesse Fletcher, a former San Quentin inmate brought in to lend expertise to the project. Wrestling his own demons, he views the students as privileged. All the prisoners and guards are excellent, but it is Miller, whose breakdown seems all too real, and Angarano, who stand out. </p><p>Miller is destined for bigger roles, and this performance -- which requires him to go from carefree spirit to man living in fear -- proves yet again he is one of the brightest young stars working today. Angarano is mesmerizing as a short guy with a short fuse who\'s punch drunk on authority and trying to emulate the warden in "Cool Hand Luke." It\'s creepy to see him don the shades and strut around. But as his character relates in a taped interview once the project is halted, no one knows for certain if he would have acted differently had the roles been reversed. </p><p>It\'s a chilling point to ponder, and one of many that "The Stanford Prison Experiment" provocatively raises. There are no easy answers, just uncomfortable questions that linger and haunt us as the list of examples of the authority abuse showing up in today\'s headlines grows ever longer. </p><div class="printinfobox"><p class="infoboxhead">\'The stanford <br />prison experiment\'<br /><p class="infoboxstars"> *  *  * &#189;<br /><p class="infoboxtextboldnobullet">Rating: R (for language including abusive behavior and some sexual references) <br />Cast: Billy Crudup, Ezra Miller, Michael Angarano, Tye Sheridan, Olivia Thirlby, James Wolk<br />Director: Kyle Patrick Alvarez<br />Running time: 2 hours, <br />2 minutes<br /></div><span fd-type="end" fd-id="default"></span></div><div class="articlePositionFooter"></div>',

(Dan Rosenstrauch/Bay Area News Group archive)</div></div></div><p>The appeals court, in finding the city\'s approach violated voter-approved Proposition 218\'s restrictions on such fees, "published" the decision, giving it legal weight across the state and prompting Gov. Jerry Brown to warn it placed a "straitjacket" on his mandates to lower water use.</p><p>Acting on behalf of the State Water Resources Control Board, Attorney General Kamala Harris in June urged the Supreme Court to "depublish" the ruling, arguing it was "unnecessary and overbroad" and hampered efforts to deal with California\'s ongoing drought. The move was designed to limit the force of the ruling to San Juan Capistrano\'s water rates. The League of California Cities also joined the state\'s effort to persuade the state Supreme Court to depublish the ruling.</p><div style="width:336px" class="articleEmbeddedAdBox"><hr class="articleAdRule"/><div class="articleAdHeader">Advertisement</div><!-- Begin DFP Premium ad uniqueId: dfp-EMBEDDED --><hr class="articleAdRule"/></div><p>But in Wednesday\'s brief order, the state Supreme Court without comment rejected the state\'s request, thus forcing local and state officials elsewhere to adapt to the ruling\'s limitations.</p><p>Harris\' office referred questions to the water resources board. Board officials said they weren\'t surprised at the Supreme Court\'s decision.</p><p>"While the court of appeal\'s decision makes it more difficult for local agencies to justify their water conservation rates, the decision does not foreclose conservation pricing," the board said in a statement. "The State Water Resources Control Board will continue to work on implementation of the Governor\'s (conservation order) and will continue to assist local agencies in developing effective and lawful conservation pricing mechanisms."</p><p>Local officials have warned the ruling from the Santa Ana-based appeals court may force cities and water districts to rely more on other tools, such as more advertising, water audits, rebate programs for low-water appliances, restrictive rules on lawn watering and fines for violators.</p><p>But legal experts and water officials also say water districts will still be able to use the tiered rates if they can demonstrate they are closely tied to the cost of providing water services.</p><p>Amid the most severe drought in California\'s 164-year history, Brown has ordered urban residents to cut water use by 25 percent statewide. One key tool that Brown had recommended was for local governments to set rate structures with higher "surcharges, fees and penalties" for people who use large amounts of water.</p><p>But that approach -- conserve or pay a much higher water bill -- was thrown into doubt by the 4th District Court of Appeal\'s conclusion that such charges may violate Proposition 218, a 1996 ballot measure that barred governments from charging more for a service than it costs to provide.</p><p>The court did not invalidate the use of rate tiers entirely. It said, however, that cities and water agencies can charge more only if they can document that it costs them more to provide the extra water.</p><p>The court ruling, because it is "published," sets statewide legal precedent that can be used in other court challenges to water district policies and at a minimum forces local water officials and lawyers to reconsider how they can legally enforce water conservation. As of now, there are two similar legal battles unfolding against the Sweetwater Authority, a San Diego area water district, and the city of Glendale\'s water district.</p><p>Taxpayer groups have warned of other legal challenges if districts violate Proposition 218\'s restrictions.</p><p>Water agencies have scrambled to interpret the ruling -- and in some cases realized they would have to adapt. In Santa Cruz, which charges a $50 per unit "penalty" for water use over 11 units per house, giving it one of the highest water conservation rates in the state, the city previously indicated it may have to rewrite its rules.</p><p class="taglinejb">Howard Mintz covers legal affairs.

"I\'m proud to be able to say that when I left, I felt good about the direction of the department."</p><p>The Yerba Buena High and San Jose State alum started as a reserve officer in 1984 and became full-time starting in 1986. His roles have included being and undercover narcotics detective, robbery unit supervisor, team leader on the MERGE (SWAT) unit, Internal Affairs commander, and deputy chief overseeing patrol. </p><p>Longtime colleagues joke that Esquivel is an ageless wonder whose manner and look -- crew cut and all -- haven\'t  changed since he joined the force. Indeed, his reserved demeanor rarely shifted no matter the circumstance.</p><p>That steely mindset was tested frequently.</p><p>When a spike in gang violence marred the first half of 2013, he engineered a citywide summer surge in patrols that tamped down activity for the rest of the year. But the department found itself backpedaling when it quietly made changes in how it classified gang crimes -- to align itself with federal standards -- and touted a decline, omitting the fact that the more restrictive criteria classified fewer incidents as gang-related.</p><p>Debates about how to measure the city\'s crime -- whether it was going up or down -- became commonplace whenever someone from a particular political faction claimed that crime in San Jose had become better or worse. Overall crime has decreased in line with national trends, but there have been isolated spikes, particularly in property crime, which resonated powerfully in a largely suburban city that a decade ago enjoyed the status of being the safest large city in the country.</p><p>Esquivel was the first chief in 14 years to shepherd the department through an on-duty death, when veteran Officer Michael Johnson was shot and killed in March while responding to a call.</p><p>Esquivel\'s announcement came on the same day that a Hayward police sergeant was killed in the line of duty, which led to a terse reaction from the San Jose Police Officers Association.  </p><p>"Today our thoughts and prayers are focused solely on our fallen brother in Hayward," read a statement from the union. "As for Chief Esquivel, we wish him the best in his retirement."</p><p>The chief visited Hayward police Wednesday morning -- that city\'s chief, Diane Urban, is a former SJPD assistant chief and a longtime colleague. </p><p>For most of Esquivel\'s tenure, his biggest challenge was staffing -- the department right now stands at around 950 officers, the first time in 30 years it has steadily been below 1,000. He has had to stretch his officers to maintain a baseline patrol, and that meant many specialized units were either cannibalized or reassigned, and such niche policing as traffic, drug and vice enforcement was severely diminished. </p><p>Increasingly mandatory overtime has been instituted, and officer fatigue compelled the department to seek outside counsel on how to re-deploy the department to make the most of its smaller staff.</p><p>Replenishing the force will be a formidable job for another chief. Besides veteran officers, many top-flight commanders have left, taking with them decades of institutional knowledge.</p><p>Still, the chief mostly avoided community ire about understaffing and the union largely refrained from criticizing him, mostly focusing its vitriol toward the mayor and the reforms aimed at reining in police retirement benefits.</p><p>But last November, outgoing union leaders spearheaded a letter urging a change in leadership in the fallout from a scandal involving officers moonlighting for the San Francisco 49ers, which complicated a domestic-violence investigation into ex-player Ray McDonald. The SJPOA criticized Esquivel and Garcia for accepting complimentary tickets from the team, which they reimbursed only after media scrutiny reached a fever pitch.</p><p>SJPD found itself scrutinized as were police throughout the country last summer after the police shootings of unarmed black men in high-profile incidents in Ferguson, Missouri, New York and South Carolina. An SJPD officer was suspended in December after posting combative social-media comments antagonizing the ensuing Black Lives Matter movement, and an initial analysis of police-stop data by this newspaper found stark racial disparities in who was being stopped and searched on the street with no discernible crime found.</p><p>But there were also several progressive acts by Esquivel\'s administration that engendered community trust. The police-stop scrutiny, for instance, stemmed from the department\'s decision to start collecting the introspective data in the first place. </p><p>And the department quickly returned to the federal government a surplus Mine-Resistant Armor-Protected (MRAP) transport vehicle that critics argued projected the image of an occupying, rather than protective, force. Plans for a police drone were pushed back for more public input after its quiet purchase spurred backlash.</p><p>More recently, the department has pledged to broaden the way it evaluates citizen complaints of racial bias and to make more transparent the way it handles internal conduct complaints. This week, the department launched its first body-camera field testing program, aiming to fully outfit the force within the next year. </p><p>"We\'re on the right track," Esquivel said. "I see a light at the end of the tunnel that our department is going to get back to what it was."</p><p class="taglinejb">Staff writers Ramona Giwargis and Katie Nelson contributed to this report.

The epicenter was at a spot just north of the intersection of Niles Canyon Road and Mission Boulevard. </p><p>The quake caused some BART delays early today while work crews checked the tracks, but appears to have caused no major damage. At least 13 smaller quakes or aftershocks have been reported near the same location as of 6:42 a.m., the largest of which was a 2.7-magnitude at 2:56 a.m. </p><p>While damage from the quake was minimal, scientists warn that a much larger one is expected on the Hayward Fault, which extends from San Pablo Bay in the north to Fremont in the south and passes through heavily populated areas including Berkeley, Oakland, Hayward and Fremont. </p><p>The last big earthquake on the fault, estimated to have a 6.8-magnitude, occurred in 1868, according to the USGS. </p><p>It killed about 30 people and caused extensive property damage in the Bay Area, particularly in the city of Hayward, from which the fault derives its name. Until the larger 1906 earthquake, it was widely referred to as the "Great San Francisco Earthquake." </p><div style="width:336px" class="articleEmbeddedAdBox"><hr class="articleAdRule"/><div class="articleAdHeader">Advertisement</div><!-- Begin DFP Premium ad uniqueId: dfp-EMBEDDED --><hr class="articleAdRule"/></div><p>"The population is now 100 times bigger in the East Bay, so we have many more people that will be impacted," said Tom Brocher, a research geophysicist with the USGS. </p><p>"We keep a close eye on the Hayward Fault because it does sit in the heart of the Bay Area and when we do get a big earthquake on it, it\'s going to have a big impact on the entire Bay Area," Brocher said. </p><p>While a 2008 report put the probability of a 6.7-magnitude or larger earthquake on the Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault system over the next 30 years at 31 percent, Brocher said the reality is a major quake is expected on the fault "any day now." </p><p>"The past five major earthquakes `on the fault~ have been about 140 years apart, and now we\'re 147 years from that 1868 earthquake, so we definitely feel that could happen any time," Brocher said. </p><p>Brocher urged residents to take steps to prepare for a major earthquake. </p><p>The USGS shake map shows residents in the areas close to Fremont and Union City experienced light shaking in this morning\'s event, while weaker shaking might have been felt in areas as far south as Santa Cruz, up the Peninsula and as far east as Livermore. </p><p>Residents throughout the Bay Area reported feeling the quake, with responses concentrated in the East and South Bay, according to the USGS. </p><p>Brocher said this morning\'s 4.0 earthquake was not likely to have much of an impact one way or the other on the likelihood of a major earthquake occurring on the same fault. </p><p></p><br><br>Copyright &#169; 2015 by Bay City News, Inc. ...

"That\'s the difference between a championship-caliber team and a championship team.</p><div style="width:336px" class="articleEmbeddedAdBox"><hr class="articleAdRule"/><div class="articleAdHeader">Advertisement</div><!-- Begin DFP Premium ad uniqueId: dfp-EMBEDDED --><hr class="articleAdRule"/></div><p>"You look at the Golden State Warriors. They were the dumbest team in the NBA for letting Mark Jackson go, who won the most games in the franchise\'s history. How could you be so dumb?</p><p>"They bring in Steve Kerr, who has been around the game for a long period of time but has never coached before. Kerr changes the culture, comes in with a different perspective, and look what happens."</p><p>You don\'t have to parse York\'s comments too much to figure out that ...</p><p>1. He\'s implying that the team was good enough to win a championship under Harbaugh but that the "culture" under Harbaugh kept the 49ers from getting over the last hurdle.</p><p>The 49ers were bad, then they hired Harbaugh and he took the 49ers to three consecutive NFC championship games; but it\'s still Harbaugh\'s fault, according to York.</p><p>Yeah, York surely would know this because the other coaches hired under his watch have been: Mike Nolan (as Jed was just coming into power), Mike Singletary and now Tomsula.</p><p>If anything tells you that an owner knows how to pick a champion leader, it\'s putting the franchise in the hands of Nolan and Singletary.</p><p>2. York is ignoring some history -- Kerr won five championships as a player under legends Phil Jackson and Gregg Popovich, was a general manager and a longtime announcer and was one of the hottest names on the coaching market when the Warriors hired him.</p><p>Tomsula has none of that background and was not one of the hottest names on the coaching market last winter.</p><p>Actually, if you\'re going to compare the Kerr hiring to anything in 49ers history, you\'d compare it to the hiring of Harbaugh -- with multiple other teams in play -- in January 2011.</p><p>But York and general manager Trent Baalke would prefer not to do that.</p><p>3. Kerr inherited a Warriors team that had just been eliminated in the playoffs and had a young core -- Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson -- and Kerr added to that by putting together one of the best coaching staffs in the NBA.</p><p>Tomsula is taking over an 8-8 team that since then has lost Patrick Willis, Justin Smith, Chris Borland, Frank Gore, Anthony Davis and several great assistant coaches.</p><p>Also, there is no reasonable person who would currently call Tomsula\'s current staff one of the best in the NFL.</p><p>4. By drawing a parallel to the Warriors\' firing of Mark Jackson, York finally is tacitly conceding that yes, he and Baalke actually fired Harbaugh.</p><p>Who was the first principal to say that Harbaugh was essentially fired? That would\'ve been Harbaugh, to me, in mid-February, after York insisted for months that the separation was "mutual."</p><p>If the CEO will mislead everyone on something as simple as this, when can you ever trust him?</p><p>5. The worst part: York isn\'t so much praising Tomsula, really, York is congratulating himself for his own daring and genius.</p><p>If Tomsula turns out to be a great coach, it will happen on the field, and York and Baalke will get full credit.</p><p>But York couldn\'t wait for the games; he had to reach for the splashiest example out there, and now anything short of an epic 49ers season will seem like a failure -- according to the owner\'s own words.</p><p>Obviously, Tomsula doesn\'t need that kind of pressure, the players don\'t need it, and the fans don\'t need it.</p><p>Jed York, though, decided it was the way to go, and if you don\'t like it, what are you going to do about it? Go get a job in Michigan?</p><p class="taglinejb">Read Tim Kawakami\'s Talking Points blog at <a href="http://blogs.mercurynews.com/kawakami">blogs.mercurynews.com/kawakami</a>.

Scott Lunger, a respected and versatile officer who loved Hayward so much he once said he\'d patrol its streets for free, was shot and killed Wednesday seconds after pulling over a driver swerving down residential streets, authorities said. </p><p>His death was felt from his hometown of Dublin to his adopted home of Brentwood, where he coached, and throughout Hayward, where he was known by day laborers, gang members and the city\'s police force. The Department now counts the father of two among the four officers it has lost in the line of duty. </p><p>Police say they arrested his suspected killer, 21-year-old Mark Anthony Estrada, but struggled for reasons why the Oakland man with no known criminal record would shoot an officer who did nothing to threaten him.</p><div class="articlePosition2" style="width:200px;"><div class="articleImageBox" style="width:200px"><span class="articleImage"><a href="/portlet/article/html/imageDisplay.jsp?contentItemRelationshipId=6963057" target="_new"><img src="http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site568/2015/0722/20150722_102852_scottlunger_200.jpg" width="200" height="161" title="Sgt.

Scott Lunger (Hayward Police Department)</div></div></div><p>"There\'s no why; it\'s an absolutely senseless murder," Hayward police Chief Diane Urban said. "We lost a warrior today. Sgt. Lunger was that \'it guy\' that was tactically sound, that was a role model for other officers. He was fit, experienced, smart, ethical -- he truly represented what we do every day in this line of work." </p><p>The shooting happened quickly, with little warning, Capt. Mark Koller said. Lunger and his partner about 3:15 a.m. were in separate patrol cars following a driver, later identified by police as Estrada, weaving near Myrtle and Lion streets. On dispatch recordings, Lunger\'s partner reported they were pulling the driver over at Lion and Kiwanis streets. About 20 seconds later, the officer is heard yelling into his radio, "Shots fired!" Frantic, he repeats those words four more times as the white Chevy Silverado truck drove off, and an officer returned fire, wounding Estrada. </p><div style="width:336px" class="articleEmbeddedAdBox"><hr class="articleAdRule"/><div class="articleAdHeader">Advertisement</div><!-- Begin DFP Premium ad uniqueId: dfp-EMBEDDED --><hr class="articleAdRule"/></div><p>"Give me fire," the officer says asking for medics. "I got one down." </p><p>"Who\'s down," asked the dispatcher.</p><p>"Sgt. Lunger is down." </p><p>Medics rushed Lunger to Eden Medical Center in Castro Valley, where he died of his wounds. The Chevy Silverado, punctured by bullets, was found dumped on 98th and Edes avenues in East Oakland. Estrada later showed up at a San Leandro hospital suffering from gunshot wounds, but was moved to Highland Hospital because the first facility did not have a trauma center, sources said. He is expected to survive. </p><p>Law enforcement was a second career for Lunger, 48. Working as an electrician, he decided 15 years ago to become an officer, joining the Hayward department, friends said. From there, he worked on the department\'s gang unit, SWAT and was known to drop by the Hayward Day Labor Center in South Hayward. He was promoted to sergeant in 2009 by then-Chief Ron Ace, who took a chance on an officer who may have lacked seniority but had a rare combination of maturity, people skills and athletic ability. </p><p>"I don\'t know he was expecting to be promoted but he was a no-brainer, an obvious choice," Ace said Wednesday. "When you look back at your promotions, you wonder did I make the wrong choice? Scott validated my decision overwhelmingly. He would have been a lieutenant in the near future if this didn\'t happen to him." </p><div class="articlePosition4"><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zNL5teGEMsRE.k0975z-4-S3M&z=11" width="300" height="300"></iframe></div><p>Outside of work, he made time to coach his two daughters, now college age, in softball or do electrical work at fellow officer\'s homes, said retired Capt. Bob Palermini. He wouldn\'t take payment for his work, Palermini said.</p><p>"I offered and he wouldn\'t take it," he said. "He\'s a guy that just cared, that was there to help out. That\'s what he did at work." </p><p>"In some ways it\'s almost like losing a family member," retired Capt. Phil Ribera said. "We are aware it can happen on the job, and it\'s something constantly on your mind. But when it happens, it\'s really devastating. It forces you to appreciate somebody like Scott who sacrificed his life."</p><p>Lunger was a mentor to former Hayward police Officer Nick Niedenthal, who called his field training officer a man of character.</p><p>"Scott loved Hayward. He told me he\'d do this job for free," Niedenthal said.</p><p>As of Wednesday afternoon, the suspect, Estrada, remained at Highland Hospital under police watch, Urban said. The Oakland man turned 21 four days ago, Urban said, and was unfamiliar to Hayward police until Wednesday. Searches related to the shooting, including Estrada\'s home in East Oakland, turned up a gun, ammunition and evidence indicating Estrada was affiliated with a gang, Urban said. Police are working to determine if the gun was used in the shooting. </p><p>Estrada, according to police, works for his father at a company in Hayward. The roofing company is located just blocks from where the shooting occurred.</p><div class="articlePosition6"><div id=\'tout_widget_fa7b01\' class=\'tout-widget\'><script charset=\'utf-8\' src=\'//www.tout.com/widgets/fa7b01.js\'></script></div></div><p>Harold Kiel, who has relatives on Beverly Place where Estrada lives, said he comes from a quiet family. </p><p>"Why in God\'s name would you shoot at a cop?" Kiel said.</p><p>Back at Eden Hospital early Wednesday, East Bay law enforcement gathered to honor Lunger, some wiping away tears and exchanging hugs. Motorcycle cops saluted the coroner\'s van carrying the fallen officer\'s body before escorting it off hospital grounds. A caravan of police cars trailed the van headed to the coroner\'s facility in East Oakland. </p><p>As the procession left, one woman who did not wish to give her name put her hand over her heart. Nearby, 16-year-old Carlos Ramirez and his mother Ophelia clutched an American flag. A buzz of helicopters is what alerted Ramirez to the shooting, he said. </p><p>"My first reaction was to take the flag off my bedroom wall ... and bring it out here to show our support because of everything police officers do for us," he said. "They\'re amazing." </p><p class="taglinejb">Staff writers Matthias Gafni, Malaika Fraley, Rick Hurd, Rowena Coetsee and Daniel Lawton contributed to this report. David DeBolt covers breaking news.

Gov. Gavin Newsom presents a wide range of choices and competing interests involved as advocates work to bring a recreational use initiative to voters next year. </p><p>Chief among the issues will be to determine how to structure licenses that growers and others in the industry will need.

(LiPo Ching/Bay Area News Group archive)</div></div></div><p>The group said it was also important to develop a regulatory system that doesn\'t make it easier for children to obtain the drug and doesn\'t encourage exports by producing more pot than Californians use. </p><p>The country\'s most populous state already has a well-established medical marijuana industry as well as a thriving black market with ties to Mexico. </p><p>"This industry should not be California\'s next Gold Rush," the report states. </p><p>The Blue Ribbon Commission on Marijuana Policy was convened by Newsom with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California. The work of the 24-member panel, which includes law enforcement representatives, tax experts, legal scholars, addiction doctors and a former White House drug policy advisor, is expected to influence several groups of marijuana activists and entrepreneurs that are trying to qualify a November 2016 ballot proposal that would legalize marijuana use for adults 21 and older. </p><div style="width:336px" class="articleEmbeddedAdBox"><hr class="articleAdRule"/><div class="articleAdHeader">Advertisement</div><!-- Begin DFP Premium ad uniqueId: dfp-EMBEDDED --><hr class="articleAdRule"/></div><p>Newsom, a declared Democratic candidate for governor in the 2018 race who supports legalization, said in an interview Tuesday that presenting the report as a series of options rather than detailed recommendations reflected both the difficulty of getting the group to agree on some of the thornier issues and the consensus that any law put before voters would ideally allow future fine-tuning. </p><p>"Perhaps the most important message from the report is what we are not recommending. We are not recommending maximizing the amount of tax revenue, we are not recommending that we promote and create a large industry, and we are not promoting and recommending that the price of marijuana drop significantly," he said. "And the reason is all of those goals would depend on and encourage heavy use." </p><p>Setting the right sales tax rate for different segments of the industry was a subject the commission singled out as integral to the overall objective of minimizing illegal activity. </p><p>If pot were taxed too highly, it would encourage sellers to stay in the illicit market, while taxes that were too low could spark a price drop that would make it easier for minors to score, said Stanford University psychiatry professor Keith Humphreys, a former adviser to the White House Office of National Drug Control. </p><p>"High prices, which you can induce by putting a minimum price on or setting high taxes, are good for deterring use, especially by kids, but if they are too high the illicit market can still continue," Humphreys said. "So that\'s a balancing act and that\'s why one of the other things we emphasize is the importance of some flexibility in the process." </p><p>At the same time, the commissioners agreed that money raised from licensing fees, taxes and fines should be funneled back into drug education programs, treatment programs for youth and policing over unlicensed growers who divert water from streams and foul public lands. </p><p>"The only regulatory tool we have over the illicit market now is to arrest people and put them in jail," said Abdi Soltani, the ACLU\'s executive director in Northern California. "When you switch to a legal market, you can test the product for safety, you can inspect the farms for their water use, and you can make sure the workers are paid a wage and not abused." </p><p></p><br style="clear:both;"/><br style="clear:both;"/><span fd-type="end" fd-id="default"></span></div><div class="articlePositionFooter"></div>',

Mark Koller said during a news conference at Hayward City Hall, where the flag was flying at half-staff Wednesday morning. The second officer returned fire, but was not hit.</p><div class="articlePosition2"><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zNL5teGEMsRE.k0975z-4-S3M&z=11" width="300" height="300"></iframe></div><p>Koller said a truck riddled with bullets had been located in East Oakland Wednesday morning and was connected to the shooting. Sources said that one person of interest, identified as Mark Estrada, 21, of Oakland, showed up at a San Leandro Hospital and was later taken to Highland Hospital to be treated for a gunshot wound on Wednesday.</p><p>Estrada was taken in to custody Wednesday afternoon, said Hayward police Chief Diane Urban. He and his family were not cooperating with officers.</p><p>Estrada worked at his father\'s business in Hayward and was familiar with the city, Urban said. The suspect may have ties with gangs, according to evidence discovered in his home. He had no prior arrests or warrants.</p><p>Police recovered a gun and ammunition from the scene, she said. The investigation was "still very preliminary" early Wednesday evening.</p><p>According to a review of dispatcher reports, officers called in a license plate because a truck was "swerving all over the road." The truck stopped, and the dispatcher read back that the plate was clear but expired, when an officer screamed, "Shots fired!"</p><p>The officer described a white Chevy Silverado truck leaving the scene.</p><p>"Shots fired! Shots fired! Shots fired! Shots fired!" the officer screamed again. "Send me ER, send fire, partner down, partner down."</p><p>The incident happened in less than 45 seconds, Urban said. "There is no \'why.\' It\'s an absolutely senseless murder," she said.</p><p>Officers from around the region had gathered at Eden hospital by midmorning and a procession followed a van carrying Lunger\'s body.</p><p>"We lost a warrior today," Urban said. </p><p>He is the fourth officer to die in the line of duty and first since Officer Benjamin Worcester was stabbed to death on March 25, 1987, according to the Hayward Police website.</p><div class="articlePosition4"><iframe width="350" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/215907138&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></div><p>Lunger had been a sergeant since 2009 and was a 15-year veteran of the police force, Koller said. He had two daughters. He was "well respected, well liked," and a member of the SWAT team and of gang unit, Koller said.</p><p>"He was an ideal police officer who loved his job and did it eagerly," Koller said. "This is a tragedy that someone did, it\'s devastating ... we\'ll pull together and get through this. This has been a tremendous loss to myself and to this organization."</p><p>Lunger was a mentor to former Hayward police Officer Nick Niedenthal, who called his field training officer a man of character.</p><p>"Scott loved Hayward," Niedenthal said. He told me he\'d do this job for free."</p><p>Hayward Mayor Barbara Halliday said she was "heartbroken" after learning of the sergeant\'s death. </p><p>"My heart aches for the family, for all of our officers. We\'re all mourning," she said, her voice cracking. </p><p>Lunger played on the Tri-Valley Athletics baseball team. On the team\'s Facebook page, teammates posted: "To our Fallen Team mate and Hayward Police Officer may tou (sic) rest in peace and we thank you for your services and friendship we will always have you in our thoughts during every game Tri Valley A\'s."</p><p>As a police procession left Eden hospital with Lunger\'s body, 16-year-old Carlos Ramirez and his mother Ophelia were there, holding an American flag. He had heard the helicopters flying overhead and wanted to show support for the police force.</p><p>"My first reaction was to take the flag off my bedroom wall ... and bring it out here to show our support because of everything police officers do for us. They\'re amazing," Ramirez said.</p><p>The neighborhood where the shooting took place is lined with single-family homes, just walking distance to the Hayward BART and City Hall.</p><p>Sulio Barraza, 25, of Hayward, who lives on Myrtle Street near shooting scene, said the nearby streets are a frequent site for drivers doing doughnuts. He said he was wakened by six police cruisers that immediately responded to the scene following the shooting. </p><p>"Last year it was a regular habit," he said about the drivers doing doughnuts. "It would happen once ever three weeks but it has been quiet for the last several months until this morning."</p><p>He said couldn\'t recall the last time there was a shooting in the neighborhood. </p><p>One woman, who declined to be identified, said she had lived in the neighborhood for 20 years and that she had never heard of a shooting there. She said she was wakened by a car spinning doughnuts, then three or four gunshots followed by a pause then more gunshots. Moments later she said there was massive sirens followed by the sound of helicopters overhead.</p><p>"Bad things happen in good neighborhoods, too," she said.
