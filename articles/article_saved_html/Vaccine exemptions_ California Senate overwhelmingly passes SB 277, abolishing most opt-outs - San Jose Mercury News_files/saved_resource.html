<p>Baby Killers! The Public Health Crisis was over by the time Senate Pro Temp "rigged the votes" and paid lobbyists were allowed to speak and grieving mothers of dead infants and physically impaired children were silenced and the Health Committee passed the bill forward without including my Amendment for Antioxidants and Vitamin C and monitoring dosages and s-p-a-c-i-n-g  vaccines. Clearly  Senator-Doctor Pan does the bidding of CMA and Pharmaceutical Companies who paid him and in spite of a blatant conflict of interest of shared profits. This is the medical mafia in our legislature that exists in Congress dictating their monopoly to secure  trillions. And, they stop at nothing to stay in power. There were no deaths from the Disneyland outbreak and Merck sales went up. I grew up without vaccines....nobody died. Mama Bears shackles are out because Mothers have done better research then Senator Doctor Pan or legislators and repercussions are on the way.  Fed Up Mothers will not be silenced and offering up their babies for the "Greater Greed" so this trillion dollar medical mafia can take away our Parental Rights and take our Freedom.</p>

Personal freedom will prevail. Let's make this happen. You'll be more informed after it does.</p>

<p>I think that anti-vexers need a tragedy to wake them up.  I mean I don't wish that on any parent AT ALL.  What burns me is that tired old "I know best" line of argument only to deny own child any type of necessary treatment and protect public health while at it.</p><p>No parent knows best in every circumstance and to sacrifice own child's health and well-being to satisfy the inner "it's all about me" is just bad parenting and has proven to result in tragedies more often than not.  A parent who does not acknowledge his/her own limitations and does not act in the best interest of their child given credible information, is no parent.</p><p>There is no definite research to take vaccinations especially against measles, mumps and rubella - communicable diseases - off the table.  It is also irresponsible and unwise to pose a public health issue in a school setting.  Don't want your child vaccinated, homeschool him or her.  The State has a legitimate right to protect public health.   IT is that simple!</p>

<p>Zogby -  some parents of autistic children are genuinely hurting and lost in their quest to find answers.  They love their children and I do not doubt that.  I do not know what Ms. Parker's motivations are but I do not find her malicious.</p><p>We may dispute her linkage assertions but keep her autistic child in mind while doing so.  She needs to stay strong for her child now and going forward.</p><p>Be gentle....</p><p></p>

<p>Yes, some parents of autistic children are hurting and looking for answers. That's not the case here.</p><p>Take 5 and read the article I linked above. Scroll though the comments and see why ciaparker2 was banned from shotofprevention and other blogs.</p><p>She uses her autistic child to garner sympathy, but her child's condition is genetic, not from any vaccine. A lot of parents of children with autism find her comments – particularly the suggestion that death and disease are better than autism –  to be actually pretty offensive.</p><p>That's as gentle as I can be.</p>

<p>I have described my daughter's vaccine reactions in many places. First  healthy, then gets vaccine, she reacted to the hep-b vaccine at the exact average time for encephalitic reactions to that vaccine to begin, and reacted in the average way, with inconsolable constant screaming for four days and nights from the pain of her brain which had swollen in reaction to the incursion of the vaccine. Delayed by her vaccine damage, but progressing, she reacted to the DTaP booster at 18 months by immediately losing her only two words, and was diagnosed with autism two months later at the Rusk Rehabilitation Center (although I did not believe it at that time). So now you, who have never seen us, have decreed that her autism was definitely and purely genetic, only to try to make unwary readers believe the lie you were hired to repeat incessantly.</p>

<p>Thank you for standing up for the parents of autistic children.. Also , these people need to do their homework.. I myself will never get vaccinated under any circumstances. I know that its all about big money &amp; eugenics if you look a little further. I refuse to follow the sheep herders on this one &amp; am disgusted with these new laws passing...sadly though, whatever I type many will never check the facts &amp; look into the thousands of double blind studies done worldwide to see that these vaccinations are filled with mercury, aluminum &amp; other poisons and are slowly injuring &amp; killing people &amp; their potential offspring :(</p>

<p>No, sadly most of America &amp; some other parts of the world have been brainwashed by Big Pharma &amp; the Medical world. This is another reason why so many people don't know about all the cures for cancer &amp; other diseases that have been around for thousands of years. It's all about money &amp; control &amp; you are obviously one of them or just maybe you are paid by one of those two to comment on here. I'm moving along. It's obvious I will never discuss this issue with the likes of someone who has either been paid to lie or has drank too much of the main-stream medical koolaide. Have a nice day &amp; good luck to you!</p>

<p>So now parents are causing neurological disease (autism, seizure disorders) and autoimmune disease (asthma, allergies, bowel disease, diabetes) in their children in record numbers by vaxing them. You cannot cite a single instance in which an unvaxed child in school gave a disabling or fatal case of any VPD to a classmate: this is a manufactured problem which doesn't really exist. What DOES exist is a huge population of autistic kids who will never be independent (one in 36 American children at this time), and no one has any idea or any plans for how to take care of them when we parents are gone.</p>

<p>And the numbers grow. These pro-vacs have no sympathy. Just think, a week with measles, a week with chicken pox etc. With the right support these illnesses are rarely fatal. My kids had chicken pox and were no different, running around, playing. Neither old enough for school. These pro-vacs can't comprehend sentencing babies to 70 years of brain damage and special needs lifestyle.  And as you say where do they go when the parents die?</p>

<p>The power of $. They just try to think of what they can say to make parents get all the vaxes, they aren't interested in the truth. So we get multiple versions of Every vaccine-preventable disease can at least occasionally kill and disable! And then they focus on those rare cases. A million repeats of Olivia Dahl died of measles encephalitis (tragically true). Baby Brady died of pertussis (although it was more from overtreatment at the hospital). Every mention of the millions disabled or killed by vaccines gets a meh...Very rare, and not EVER proven to be the definite cause. Kid gets screaming syndrome shortly after a vaccine, they're programmed to say, Babies cry. In every instance it's REALLY just colic. Or purple screaming syndrome. No such thing as vaccine encephalitis (even though many studies have been done on it for over seventy years, and it's on nearly every vaccine package insert as a possible consequence of vaccines. Kid gets autism as a result? Nonsense, remember, it was just colic. There is no cause of autism, it's genetic, totally and always born with it, even in the cases of normal development, walking, talking, socializing, then vaccine and BAM! Autism and bowel disease! Just a coincidence, even though hundreds of thousands of parents have seen it, they're all deluded or lying! Even though there was NO autism before vaccines! People didn't use to even recognize that inability to communicate and socialize was abnormal, and so they just sort of failed to EVER mention it ANYWHERE. Even Dr. Kanner's colleagues at Johns Hopkins when they wrote an anthology, Childhood Psychiatry, in which EVERY mental condition ever known in history was described, with NOTHING even resembling autism mentioned, doesn't matter. There WERE no real scientists before 2000. Or 2010. Whatever they think they can get away with. Every mention of the benefits of the natural diseases, the relative mildness of most cases of most of them, the need to educate the immune system by letting it deal with the formerly universal childhood diseases gets a DR.

<p>Zogby at the beginning of April made his début as a pharma shill using that picture of a young man with Down's syndrome holding a baby to taunt us, Suz found the site where he had gotten the photo. I flagged it a little while ago, and that must have been the flag that put it over the limit, because it scintillated and disappeared. The nym of the person who put it up here again was "Rainbow Sparkles," and if you look for his Disqus commenting history, it may still be there. He had only made fifty comments, obviously just an old commenter using a new nym.</p>
