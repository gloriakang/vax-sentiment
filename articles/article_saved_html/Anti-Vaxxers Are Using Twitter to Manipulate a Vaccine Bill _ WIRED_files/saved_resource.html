<p>When both rotavirus vaccines are known to be contaminated with pig virus DNA and who knows what other animal viruses, I would ask why they feel it is still safe to use vaccines known to be infected with Porcine Circovirus.</p><p>Investigation of porcine circovirus contamination in human vaccine-Two additional rotavirus vaccines, a pentavalent human–bovine reassortant vaccine and a monovalent naturally occurring less virulent human strain, were each extensively tested in more than 60,000 children before their licensure in 2006 and 2008, respectively, to be certain that they were not associated with intussusceptions. In 2010 DNA fragments of porcine circo- virus (a single-stranded DNA virus that naturally infects pigs) were detected in one vaccine and then the second vaccine. After extensive review, the FDA determined that it was still safe to use both vaccines.Biologicals. 2012 Jul;40(4):270-7. doi: 10.1016/j.biologicals.2012.02.002.

Presence of PCV DNA was detected in cells and supernatant by PCR, expression of viral proteins by an indirect immune fluorescence assay.

Here we report, for the first time, definitive evidence of productive PCV1 infection in a subclone of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line.</p><p>**While the direct relevance to vaccine safety of PCV1 growth in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells is unclear, these data should be considered in further evaluation of vaccines and other products that could contain infectious PCV1.**</p><p>Affiliation; Department of Biomedical Sciences and Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, 1981 Kraft Drive, Blacksburg, VA 24061-0913, United States.</p>

<p>Wow, you people really are this obtuse? CS earlier was claiming that thimerosal is not dangerous because it does not contain inorganic mercury. As if mercury of any kind is not toxic.</p><p>Now we learn from you that having foreign swine DNA fragments fed to infants and children is safe, because...you know...pork. The studies Ione shared themselves found there to be reason for concern, and that further research was warranted.</p><p>How do you pro-vaccine ideologues say things like this with a straight face, and expect to have a shred of credibility left? And of course your platoon of ditto-heads upvote your nonsense, documenting their ignorance as well as yours.</p>

<p>“I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.”<br>CDC scientist and whistleblower Dr William Thompson</p>

<p>And that is 100% your choice and your choice for your child. But this debate is about forcing others to make that choice. I am pro-vaccine too, but I also contend that I have a right to make the best choices for my child. If that means delaying the vaccination schedule or reducing 1 or 2 vaccinations entirely then that should be my prerogative.</p>

<p>You still would have the right not to vaccinate your child. But other, better parents deserve the right to choose not to expose their children to your unvaccinated children. None of this proposed legislation would forcibly vaccinate your kids. It would only keep your potentially deadly children away from kids who cannot be vaccinated for health reasons, or have baby siblings that are too young to vaccinate. You may homeschool them, or anti-vaxxers can get together and build private schools.</p>

<p>So when these kids that can't be vaccinated catch it and give it to your kids what then? Kill them because your child might get sick? Heard them up and make them live in camps shut off from the world? When do you stop and maybe look at the company's that can't seen to get it right. Plus your talking as if the vaccines are 100% effective and the company's that make them will not even make that claim.</p>

<p>A new amendment to the bill would allow kids on an IEP to elude the vaccine mandate. So kids already vaccine-damaged don't have to get any more, but normal kids have to play vaccine roulette, and then once they are brain-damaged as well, can get out of the line of fire. Sort of like prison dodge ball. So your kid may get hep-B or AIDS from infected kids at school, may get pertussis, measles, etc., from the large and ever-growing number of kids at school on IEPs, and also has to take the 50-50 chance of being severely damaged by vaccines. And also get flu and pertussis from anyone, since those vaccines are so ineffective, while still very dangerous. Does anyone think Californians are going to take that lying down? Efforts are under way to recall Pan and others who are promoting this travesty. </p>

<p>There are pockets of populations in America with lower vaccination rates than third world countries.  Most Mexicans crossing the border are better vaccinated than that.</p><p>I appreciate the ones that are at least honest - let everyone vaccinate and risk their children, and let me hide in herd immunity where the illnesses are mostly eradicated.</p><p>These people are reacting to fear-mongering.  The anti-vaccination proponents blame every disease extant on vaccination, when other things, including medical intervention allowing weaker children to survive healthy, pollution, genetic mutation, etc., etc., can also be to blame.  Read a fascinating "vaccine recovery" of a child who has asthma.  It is very common for a child to outgrow that...  but, they blamed it on vaccination, spent tons at a naturopath detoxing, and blamed a natural event on vaccines and snake oil...</p>

<p>wuzzi ....Firstly when did I mention Mexicans coming over your borders I mentioned tourists and or visitors.. Secondly I will say you are spewing the same old same old. Fear mongering.. it is you who tries to scare with your posts.. Re "Talk to the parents of the child in Spain who died of diphtheria"...and yes that is very sad no doubt .. however I do not see you shedding any tears for the 1 in 68 children who are autistic.. the epidemic of child hood illness's.. air infections.. asthma.. diabetic in children that in numbers never seen before.. and of course there is childhood cancers.. which have skyrocketed.. and all the immune diseases.. the list goes on and on.. ADD ADHD.. Well you sure do not give a dam about these parents.. the vaccine injuries are criminal.. yet parents are forced to vaccinate and still sign consent forms to do so...in the great country of America. Why do you not question this WHY???????  I think I know the answer to this....</p><p>I case of measles diagnosed to 7000 cases of autism and that is not even mentioning all the other illness and diseases... Get over your self.. I am sick of listening to such rubbish when our children are getting sicker and sicker and this is 2015.... if you cared about the babies and children of this earth you would want them to eat healthy food... NOT GMO&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>A new government survey in USA has found that approximately 1 out of every 13 children is taking at least one medication for emotional or behavioral problems..... WOW How healthy .. but sure you agree with this...</p><p>A study from the 1990s has come to light, proving that compared to unvaccinated children, vaccinated children were more likely to suffer from asthma, eczema, ear infections, hyperactivity and many other chronic conditions. Furthermore, the study identified that there was a ten-fold increase in the incidence of tonsillitis in the children who were vaccinated, and a total lack tonsillectomy operations among the children who were unvaccinated.</p><p>In 1992, the Immunization Awareness Society (IAS) conducted a survey to examine the health of New Zealand’s children. Unsurprisingly, the results of their study indicated that unvaccinated children were far healthier than vaccinated children.  I suppose you will say this is a lie.. I so pray that the States never gets a hold on the beautiful country... with its BIG Pharma.. and MOSANTO Devil.... and God help any country who goes near the TPP free Trade Deal.(Free Trade Deal.. more like hell here we come). Life will change for New Zealand that is for sure and Australia.. and we just do not want that in our part of the world...</p><p>(August 2001) Asthma afflicts a rapidly growing number of children in the United States. The total number of children suffering from this chronic disease increased by 75 percent between 1980 and 1994. The illness has grown fastest among the youngest children: The number of children under 5 years of age with asthma surged by 160 percent during that same time period. Today, asthma affects 4.8 million Americans under the age of 18, or one out of every 15 kids. It is the leading chronic illness for children in the United States.  AND THIS WAS 2001 IMAGINE THE RTES NOW....Funny how it coincides with the vaccines....</p><p>Childhood Cancer is becoming an "epidemic" in the United States. It is robbing children of the only thing they want-a normal childhood.</p><p>Oh yes lets put more toxic chemicals into our babies and children.. lets feed them pesticides on and in  their food.. lets ... and lets be so sad that we will make more children sick not thousands but millions because of 1 case of a child dying.. and that does not take away the sadness I feel for the parents.. so please to not use this as TROLL usually do.. I care about all our children DO YOU????????</p>

<p>Excuse me BonnieJ - NO ONE is born with a communicable disease.  No one.  These diseases (diptheria, pertussis, polio, etc.) are all caused by infected water, poor sanitation, poor and under nutrition.  There are many studies that show high doses of certain supplements have eliminated the symptoms of most of these diseases.  Vaccinated persons do carry the disease.  According to many reports - all cases of polio in the US since 1979 are due to the vaccine.  This was reported in NEJM.  Please do your homework before you blame unvaccinated children on the shedding of vaccinated children.</p>

<p>So, you are putting down children? Hmm, that's kind of sad. Unvaccinated kids are healthier. Vaccinated kids have chronic ear and sinus infections, maybe because their parent's are too lazy to read a package insert and don't know vaccines contain aborted fetal cells, aluminum, formaldehyde. Btw, autism, seizures and SIDS are listed as adverse reactions to the DTaP vaccine. Way to go Mom.</p><p><a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/biologicsbloodvaccines/vaccines/approvedproducts/ucm101580.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/downloads/b...</a></p>

<p>And YOU need to read the vaccine inserts, rather than accept at face value what antivaccine propaganda websites tell you they say.</p><p>If you bother doing that, you will find a disclaimer that states reported "events" recorded after vaccination need not be causal, and may be coincidental. You will also realise that by statute, companies have to list ALL events reported during vaccine trials and followup within their vaccine inserts. Hence you find things reported as "events" such as accidental drowning and car accidents. <br>And those are in black and white too.</p>
